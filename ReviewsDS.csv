Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.  HOLY WOW! It Ends With Us is one of the most powerful books of 2016 and one of the most raw  honest  inspiring  and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. It wasn’t anything like what I expected  but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like… READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it  all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It's a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don't think I've ever been prouder of a heroine. I've loved Colleen Hoover's books for a long time because she always writes unique stories... and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completely    spoiler-free review . I'm not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It's a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it's amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest  I'm the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance  but I've really learned to trust Colleen's writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all... and I was blown away by the story!This book is unputdownable. You'll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep  I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I've ever read  Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages  but having finished the book  I truly couldn't be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I'd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are  but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don't think I've been this proud of a fictional character before.There's an incredibly powerful message in this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter  but you don't yet realize how significant each of these moments truly are... and as you read more  these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw  honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I'm not mentioning it on purpose because I don't want you to expect it. The fact that it's unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it's also unexpected for the heroine. As she begins to realize what kind of situation she's in  so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journey with her.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the 'love triangle' because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don't want to spoil the plot at all  but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point  or the focus. Whatever it is you're thinking this book is  just trust me -- it's so much bigger than that. Seriously  trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader  I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do)  it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger  I'm always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time -- not this literal story  but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant -- and there's this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such a strong impact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went 'woah!'. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review  I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn't possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make a seriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people -- whether they've personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has -- so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don't want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it to  everyone !  That’s what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them.It can save them.  Rating: 5+ STARS! Standalone.

Also  I spoil things  so back away quickly if you don’t want this one to be ruined for you.My glaring 1 Star in a sea of 5s probably makes it pretty clear that I detested this book  but please refrain from fetching your torches and pitchforks for a moment and take note that not only did I just 5 Star a CoHo Story two weeks ago (as well as shoved it down everyone’s throats I possibly could)  but also I want to make all of the sexuals with Miles Archer and will fight anyone for dibs on his imaginary lurv making. I didn’t pick this up in order to hate on it. I’m one of you . . . . sometimes. Definitely not this time  but lots of times. And this is why I don’t ever give up on Hoover novels. I never know how I’m going to react.Allow me to explain what went wrong for me with this one . . .   Let’s start with the obvious annoyances that seem to be in nearly every NA book that drive me batshit before getting to the real nitty gritty. First  the character names. Ryle  Lily Bloom and Atlas???????  Is it against the law to not use absolutely ridiculous (™Ron2.0) names in these books???? Second . . . .  “Your lips. I love how they’re as red as your hair.”   According to Google (all hail Google) less than 2% of the world’s population has red hair  and yet 99.998% of all NA leading ladies do. Just stahp.Third  non-existent chemistry. In this story Lily and Ryle meet by chance on a rooftop after experiencing respective miserable days. In a matter of minutes Lily goes from worrying the stranger on the roof could be a psycho killer/rapist to getting into his super sexy (NOT) pick-up lines . . .  “If you wouldn’t sleep with someone you just met . . .” His eyes meet mine again. “Exactly how far would you go?” Ewww. She already said thanks but no thanks freakshow so STFU.Now let’s move on to the real big issue. I took a gander at my friends’ reviews before I started typing this and noticed my buddy Chelsea was the only other naysayer in the batch. She summed it up perfectly when she talked about the massive amounts of emotional manipulation that was forced down the readers’ throats in order to make them feel all the things.It’s a running joke with my friends/family/co-workers that I have a robot heart. And for the majority of the time it’s true. I generally experience two emotions – happiness and annoyance. But even a robot like me can be manipulated into having a feeling/crying the ugly tears like a Kardashian once in a blue moon (*cough Me Before You cough*). This time  though? It was like a flashing neon sign . . . .   To begin with  our first leading male Atlas is a homeless teenager who Lily befriends/eventually loses her virginity. In case you don’t get the writing on the wall  Atlas is being set up as the most perfect perfection that ever perfected. He’s also the way to getting the “raised in an abusive household” plotline uncovered. Like in all NA stories  Atlas and Lily are torn apart. Lily moves on with her life  graduates college  yada yada  and  as mentioned above  meet-cutes super creeper Mr. Right 2.0 on the roof. Mr. Right 2.0 is not only another most perfect perfection that ever perfected  but he’s also rich and a neurosurgeon and very obviously husband material even though he’s never had a girlfriend (also after dating only six months)  annnnnnnnd due to their mutually busy schedules not really knowing the guy.It wasn’t too hard to see where the story was going to go (and no  I hadn’t been spoiled because I didn’t read any reviews or the synopsis  I just auto-request everything by Hoover from both NetGalley and the library). Basically this was a story about domestic abuse and making excuses not only the first time he knocks your ass down “on accident” but also the second time when you wake up after “falling” down the stairs and hearing his sob story about a superbadawful that effed him up as a kid and then agreeing on a policy where  “When you’re upset  just walk away. And I’ll walk away”  (because THAT’S going to fucking work) and then saying  “It’s okay  Ryle. It’s okay. You were angry  it’s okay”  and making sure even when you’re bleeding profusely out of your fucking skull and are concussed and have quite possibly just been raped by your own damn husband that you get taken to an emergency room in a hospital other than the one where your bastard abuser works in order to protect his ass as well as explaining   “sometimes the reason women go back is simply because they’re in love”  and in case all that wasn’t e-fucking-nough you add in a whoopsie baby (another NA per usual) to serve as the wake-up call that maybe it’d be a good idea to ditch this zero and eventually find you a hero  buuuuuuuuuuuut you just come to an agreement regarding visitation and whathaveyou rather than involving the court and much needed supervised interaction because you know he wouldn’t hurt the baby since it’s obvious he loves her . . . .   Nope. I’m well aware I’m going against the grain here. I give zero fucks. Don’t bother trolling me to tell me how stupid I am (especially if you’re a teenager who has lived a privileged lifestyle and never experienced anything contained in this book for yourself). I went to the wholesale club yesterday and stocked up on big ol’ batch of . . . .   I will be using it freely.Many thanks to the library for having nearly every book I ever want to read – especially books like these that are only approved to fangirling 5 Star reviewers prior to publication. ...more  ,

I'll repeat: THIS IS A BOOK THAT NEEDS TO BE READ! This story is moving. It will make you think about things that are uncomfortable to think about. It will lift your heart  devastate you at times  make you proud  fill you with sorrow and make you smile. It will move you. It’s powerful and intense in the best way  but also has hopeful and lighter moments. The story itself is one that has been heavy on my heart from the moment I finished it. Sometimes  I read a book and it’s so beautiful  influential and emotional I will cry just thinking about the characters and their story. Not in a bad way necessarily  I just get that moved and that emotional while thinking about it. That is this book. Trying to find the words for this review is bringing me to tears. It’s hard to explain the story completely spoiler free  but this isn’t a ‘sad’ book. It’s a strength book. Because dealing with the issues in this story took so much strength.   I’m not going to talk about the actual story at all  but I will speak a bit about the characters. Lily. Speaking of strength  Lily may be the strongest heroine that I’ve read about. Your strength is really tested when you are put in a hard situation where your choices are impossible. I loved Lily so much. I was proud of Lily and the choices she made. I want to be Lily when I grow up.  Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back. There are two men in this story  but please don’t think this is a triangle book. It’s not. It’s hard to explain  but it’s not. Ryle is a charming guy. He’s a giving person. He’s got a lot of great attributes. I’m not sure if I’ve ever felt so conflicted over a character as I did him. Atlas is the type of man I always have a soft spot for as a reader. His story gutted me at times  but he is also a character with a lot of strength and so much beauty. I loved Atlas from the second I met him and that love never stopped throughout the book.    “Lily?” he whispers  looking at me sincerely. “You just might be the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”  Aside from the three main characters in the story  Lily’s mom played a prominent part. Their relationship played an even bigger part. Ryle’s sister and Lily’s best friend Alyssa was one of my favorite characters in this book. When things got hard she was there. One line she said in the book  to Lily just solidified the type of woman she was. Coleen always writes that one side character that you love so hard in her stories  and Alyssa was that character for me. I can’t not mention Ellen  because  well  it’s Ellen. That part was brilliant. It made me smile every time Ellen was mentioned.   When reading this book  there were moments I struggled between not being able to tear my eyes away from the page  and others I had to take a breather because I couldn't handle what was going on.Parts of this story left me so heartbroken and others lifted me up so high. There are some parts that are just so powerful I could only read them in awe. This is it. This is why I read. Books like this.   All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.   Colleen Hoover is an author who truly has a way with words. She killed this book. I’ve read and loved all of CoHo’s books. Some of her earlier books are some of my all-time favorites. I’ve enjoyed all of her latest books  but this is by far the best book she’s ever written. And it’s tied with Hopeless as my own personal favorite book by her. And that is saying a lot  because Hopeless is one of my top books ever.   If you only read one book this year  let it be It Ends with Us. Everyone needs to read this book. 5+ star favorite. Completely unforgettable and highly recommended!   “It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”      ...more  ,

Don't ask me why  I really don't know. What I do know is that I haven't been on Goodreads in nearly six months and it's entirely your fault that i'm here now. So  if i stumble upon a poor review on one of my books and end up in the fetal position on my kitchen floor surrounded by Ding Dong wrappers  well  I'm blaming it on you. I've even given my husband instructions to bill you for the psychiatry bill if that happens.On Friday I had a hysterectomy. It wasn't the worst day of my life  but it certainly wasn't the best. One chapter of my life--quite possibly the best chapter--ended. The surgery itself took twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. Can you believe that? Twenty minutes to take out the uterus that carried my three beautiful babies for a total of twenty eight months. Twenty minutes to change my life. Don't feel bad for me  that's not what I want. The offending organ had to come out  I knew this. But it didn't make it any easier. It didn't make the finality of the situation any easier. In all honesty  for a couple of minutes I didn't just feel like a chapter was ending  more like an entire flipping book. Maybe my life isn't made up of chapters  maybe it's part of a duet  or a trilogy? Either way  part of my story was over. Over a matter of several hours  I slowly woke up from surgery and at one point I remember sitting there and just staring at the wall paper in my hospital room. My uterus was gone. Mauve diamonds. The wallpaper was covered in mauve diamonds.That's the most hideous color  don't you think? Mauve. Not quite pink. Not quite maroon. I counted seven hundred and fifty three diamonds before I allowed the first tear to fall. But I wasn't just crying for losing a part of my body  and I wasn't crying for losing the ability to carry more children. I was crying because some women don't even get to experience what I've gotten to experience. Some women never get to have babies. They never get to feel them grow in their bellies. They never get to see the slimy little monsters as they tumble their way into this world.And I did.I got to do all of that three times.So why was I so upset? What the hell was my problem? I should be grateful  right? Happy?My husband slept soundly in the chair  snoring softly  but at some point my cries must have woken him up. He stirred and I did the only thing I could do ... I grabbed your book. You see  it was sitting on my bedside table. I buried my nose between the pages and when my better half asked me if I was okay I simply peeked over the top of the book and whispered  ""Colleen. She did it again.""I didn't need to say much more  he knows my obsession with your words and I found myself grateful. Grateful that he knew your books make me cry and grateful that you inadvertently allowed me to grieve. And that's what I did. I read your book and I grieved. I cried when Lily cried. I cried when Ryle cried. And even when no one was crying  I still cried simply because I needed to and I could and no one thought twice about it because i was reading and that's what i do when i read. It was my outlet  my excuse for the tears that wouldn't go away  the tears that kept falling despite my desperate protest.I cried for all of the Lily's in the world  and the Ryle's too. I cried for the Atlas'. And I cried for the Kirby's (that's my name. No i'm not named after a vacuum  or a cream puff)But you see  I didn't want to cry. I didn't want to be upset. I have three beautiful children whom I love with my entire heart. My body did it's job extremely well and that is something to be proud of. But why wasn't I proud? Naked truth?I'm selfish.I wanted one more baby even though my husband didn't. I wanted one more baby when there are women out there that can't have any at all.So why am I telling you this? My story is nothing like Lily's. Not even close. But maybe it is ... She wanted something she shouldn't want. I wanted something I couldn't have. She had a decision to make ... one that would change her life. So did I. She made a decision that was right for her and for her life at that particular time. Ditto.But the real reason I'm telling you this is because for two days I was drowning and It Ends With Us was my lifeline. It's what I grabbed when I needed to stop thinking ... it's what I grabbed when i needed to cry ... and when i finally finished the book and put it down  it wasn't mauve diamonds that I saw ... it was my smiling children.My three beautiful smiling children ... and my niece Lily. -- Kirby ...more  ",
9781471156267,it was amazing,"  It Ends With Us... Wow I really don't know what to truly say about this novel. This review will be a little light because  like most CoHo books  you'll want to go into it with little to no information. I went into this book thinking it was going to be this one thing  and it turned out to be the complete opposite. IEWU follows Lily  a girl in her early twenties  who has never had it easy. Though coming from a family that was better off she has always had to work for the things she's wanted. After It Ends With Us... Wow I really don't know what to truly say about this novel. This review will be a little light because  like most CoHo books  you'll want to go into it with little to no information. I went into this book thinking it was going to be this one thing  and it turned out to be the complete opposite. IEWU follows Lily  a girl in her early twenties  who has never had it easy. Though coming from a family that was better off she has always had to work for the things she's wanted. After graduating college she gets up and moves to Boston and hopes to start her own business. While there she meets and falls for Ryle  a thriving neurosurgeon who is determined to be the best in his field. The two hit it off hard  and things seem almost too good to be true. Ryle is everything that Lily is not. He is forward  assertive  and stubborn. He is also a lot of thing Lily is; he is strong  passionate  and motivated. Though the two have an immediate connections and sparks fly  the two decided to take their time getting to know one another. Lily is such a beautifully written leading lady. I loved getting to grow with her and be apart of her journey. I loved hearing her thoughts and seeing how she processed things. When I was first reading and got to the point where she does her journal entries  but she does them so they are letters to Ellen DeGeneres  I thought I wasn't going to like that aspect of it. The first few had me thinking ""this is a little cheesy""  but the more I got into it the more I started to enjoy them. They really tied Lily's past and present perfectly together. As Lily's and Ryle's relationship pushes forward she finds herself looking back at those entries and thoughts of her first love Atlas resurface. Atlas was her first everything and was the biggest impact on her life. Atlas was the homeless boy who found his way into the abandoned house next door. Atlas and Lily as teens formed an unlikely friendship. Sharing everything and having a bond that no one around them seemed to understand. Spending every possible moment together and having so many stolen ones the two were kindred spirits. When Atlas reappears in the story it truly threatens everything Lily and Ryle have. (not a spoiler it's given he eventually will). Both Ryle and Atlas bring such important and different aspects to this story. I think CoHo manages to make them both such polar opposites  but at the same time manages to make them mesh so well.The characters in the book  main or side  all feel so realistic and authentic. When it comes to the plot there is almost nothing I can say about it. I hope everyone will do the same to keep things from getting spoiled. The story is an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. It's one of those books that you will have a thousand theories about and all of them will be wrong. I kept trying to guess what I thought might happen next and in classic Hoover style she managed to surprise me. This book was solid from page one and was steady throughout  but around the 80% mark is where things really took a turn (in the best way possible).  IEWU hit me on such a personal level. I didn't expect this book to impact me so hard. It had everything I wanted from a New Adult read. It's very classic CoHo  but it also branches out somewhere she's never been before  but she does it with such ease. She manages to weave these heavy moments with ones that will make you swoon  laugh  and then cry. My favorite part of this book though  was the author's note. Usually author's notes are at the beginning of the story  however it is so important that this one was left for the end. It took a book that was good and made it exceptional! God  this note effected me like so few books have. It made me cry fifty times harder than the entire book or anything Colleen's ever written.  Finding out how important this book was for her to write will hit you hard  but I hope she also knows how important it is as a reader to read. Knowing where an author gets their ideas from can change your whole outlook on a book  and this one... this one broke me.Thank you Colleen Hoover for continuing to gift the reading community with your words. ...more  ",
9781471156267,really liked it,"   Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them. 4 1/2 stars. Holy crap  what a book. This is unlike anything Hoover has written before. I have so many emotions right now that it's hard to know where to start  but I think everyone should read this book. That's right: everyone.

That's right: everyone. I could easily give everything away. I could  but I won't. If you go looking for lots of reviews  it won't be hard to work out what It Ends with Us is about. And if you do  you should still read it  but I think it's better if you don't. I think you should go into this book knowing as little as possible. Just realize that this is something very different from Hoover's usual new adult romances (that I admittedly have had all kinds of problems with).So I don't want to say too much  but this is an extremely powerful story and it's not what most people will be expecting. It gets its power from the singular first person narrative (I'm honestly not a big fan of the alternating male/female POV romances) and we experience everything through Lily's eyes. When she falls in love  we fall in love; when her heart is broken  our heart is broken; when she gets it all wrong  so do we.I cannot stress how important and damn smart this book is. There is no black and white characterization - it's much deeper and more complex than that  and therefore  far more emotional. It peels back the layers of characters and relationships to do something that so many other authors have tried and failed to do - to make you understand a situation that for most people makes no sense. It's very sad  painful and exceptionally honest. My heart hurt while reading it and I almost cried several times.As well as all this emotion and sadness that I'm being coy about  Hoover also brings out some of her very best writing. Little gems of honesty about human nature and relationships that are all the more painful because of their resounding truth. It's such a quotable book  but unfortunately most of the quotes are spoilers  so I shall refrain from posting them.There's so many great things to mention  but I keep getting distracted by my feelings. The narrative is interspersed with letters that Lily wrote as a teenager and they are addressed to Ellen Degeneres - a strange touch that ends up being absolutely perfect. Shit  just writing this review and remembering the story is an emotional experience.And then there's the absolutely fantastic female friendship. I want Allysa to be my best friend. Hoover clearly knows her audience of 16-25 year old women  creating characters with their quirks and habits - Allysa  for example  is a self-confessed ""Pinterest whore""  which made me laugh. But seriously  she is the best friend ever and she says one of the most perfect lines in this book.Anyway  I'm just going to start rambling soon because I read this book in a whirlwind of emotions throughout a single day. I've been up since a ridiculous time and I need to go sleep now. But really  give this book a chance. I thought it was excellent.Trigger Warnings: (view spoiler)[Domestic abuse (physical  occasionally graphic). Attempted rape.

This is like the stupidest thing ever  like not a single bad person has ever donated money to charity. I actually hated the stupidity of this so much I probably would have given the book 1 star just for it alone. It's not only stupid thinking but it's stupid writing because nobody can be that that naive so why on fucking earth would you write your character that way? And what was all that fucking shit about how there aren't good or bad people just people who do bad things? An abuser is a bad person. He is not a good person who does bad things. He is a bad bad bad person who does bad bad bad things. That is black and white and don't fucking try to tell me any different. Donating to a charity does not make it okay to rape your wife  because that is literally the argument that the main character tried to make. Okay  and here's the thing that really killed the book for me: this was 250 pages of abuse as sexy romance and 50 pages of a boring-ass Wikipedia page on abuse. And make no mistake  this was a sexy romance with a lot of sex. Don't get me wrong  I love me some sexy romance. But when the sex is abusive and controlling AND I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR IS A GOOD ENOUGH WRITER TO HAVE MEANT IT TO BE ANYTHING BUT SEXY AND TITILLATING  it's not sexy sex. I mean  come on  the abusive shithead says he wants to fuck the main character (and says it to her!) as his first line? Yeah  hello abuser. And you know what  I absolutely don't think we were supposed to see this as anything but flirting. Except until we are told to see it as abuse. And that's the biggest problem with this book  that the last fifty pages I was hit over and over the head (hahaha  abuse pun!) with this perfect character who has doubts which totally make her a Real Human but she is a Strong Woman so she will stop the cycle of abuse. It would have been more entertaining to just read a pamphlet from the local women's shelter. Absolutely nothing felt authentic. Every single character was perfect and their lives  excepting the abuse duh  were perfect. Magical best friends appear out of thin air  magical businesses appear out of thin air  and magical success of said business appears out of thin air. And this shit wasn't magical realism so yeah  fuck the magical friends and their magical lives. And fuck this magical Strong Woman who will stand up to her abuser. And here's the one final straw: she didn't stand up for herself  she stood up for her daughter. Sort-of. I mean  we didn't see anything about custody hearings or anything like that  just that Strong Woman allowed this abusing abuser to spend time with his daughter  you know  because he really loved her and wouldn't hit her. Having the main character only tell her abuser no because of her daughter just morphed boring  cliched Strong Woman into boring  cliched Strong Mother. Lifetime Special masquerading as YA romance. Oh  yeah  no spoiler tag here because fuck y'all this book deserves to be spoiled. Spoiled rotten and thrown out with the trash. ...more  ,

(hide spoiler)]even though i didn't enjoy the process of reading this book  i'm grateful to have read it. there are some books you read for pleasure and there are some you read to gain knowledge and perspective. this is the latter. ...more  ,

He is handsome  successful  and so thoroughly smitten by Lily he can barely think. He makes advances while claiming he doesn't do relationships. She rebuffs him while secretly pining for him. Really  it's all fun and a bit frivolous  your standard romance.But then we arrive at the core of this story  which I won't spoil because it's best to read it from Colleen Hoover's own words. I'll just say that the main topic in here is something that a lot of books try to tackle  but very few do right. Hoover's portrayal is brutal and compelling  and it's hard to look away. Her nuanced approach makes the whole thing ring true  and she brings a humanity to it that is both sobering and heartbreaking.I read this book years ago when it first came out  and I remember thinking highly of it  though not much else. So when I read it again this time  I admit I was shaken by how hard it hit me. I think it's because I'm older now and have more experience with love and relationships  so I'm able to appreciate this story even more.My suggestions if you're going to read this book: have a box of tissues ready and don't skip the author's note at the end. I sobbed my way to the finishing line  then read the author's note and sobbed some more. This is a riveting and worthwhile read  though at times difficult  and it showcases Colleen Hoover at her best  taking her contemporary new adult genre and elevating it to soaring heights.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also  my thoughts on:VerityReminders of HimRegretting YouLayla ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ...more  ",

This is the most moving book that I've read in a LONG time. It was absolutely addicting  but so difficult at times. I don't cry very often  but this one had me crying big  fat tears. It's been a couple of days since I finished 'It Ends With Us' and I'm still thinking about Lily's story. It's one that'll hang with you. In so many ways  her story gutted me. Yet  it  Phenomenal!

It's been a couple of days since I finished 'It Ends With Us' and I'm still thinking about Lily's story. It's one that'll hang with you. In so many ways  her story gutted me. Yet  it was also inspiring.Lily grows up in an abusive household. After watching her mother suffer for years at the hand of her father  she tells herself that she'll never allow any man to treat her that way. She grows into a strong and independent woman  leaving behind the horrors of her childhood...Or so she thinks.Despite everything she's promised herself  Lily finds herself in an abusive relationship. The behavior and cycle is so insidious that you almost can't believe what is happening. Ms. Hoover manages to weave the violence into a relationship that is otherwise seemingly perfect. It is so skillfully written that you won't want to believe what you've read.  I found myself making excuses for the abuser. I didn't want to believe that he wouldn't change. For the first time  I could understand why women make excuses for abusers. I can only imagine how strong that pull must be in reality if I felt so strongly about a fictional character. I am in awe of Lily. Her strength and conviction blew me away. I don't think I would've been strong enough to do what she did. She was an amazing character.This was a beautiful and heartbreaking book. I recommend it to everyone. It is a must read. ...more  ,

You want the best for her and you fight with her from cover to cover. i adored her character and reading her journey.i was so scared that this would end it a way that would have been unrealistic or just covered up in hearts and butterflies like we didn’t just witness 300+pages of trauma. but it didn’t  it quite literally ends with us. and you won’t know what that means until the very end. yes i cried. a lot. all for different reasons but i ended the book with the biggest smile on my face. it truly felt like i was on a journey with Lily  like i was vicariously living through her. this is definitely a favorite book of mine that i’ll be taking to the grave. i loved it so much and if anyone has anything negative to say about it you are simply wrong. i get the hype now and i was blown away. it went above and beyond from my expectations. if you plan to read this book  look up TWs because it’s very very intense. more intense than i realized. do not romanticize these characters because that’s just speaking over their trauma and experiences. and READ THE AUTHORS NOTE  it tells you how this came about. every page of this is worth it  if you can handle the subject matter of course.  ...more  ,

How is it possible to switch from denial to sorrow to fury to acceptance in a heartbeat?  “There is no such thing as bad people.

How is it possible to switch from denial to sorrow to fury to acceptance in a heartbeat?  “There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”   I did my best not to cry. I felt sick  but I clenched my jaw and forced myself to keep reading  trying in vain to ignore the tremors that ran through my body. But when the last chapters came  and Colleen's note in the end  I couldn't take it any more. I dissolved into angry  hot tears  and I checked my chest to make sure my heart was not bleeding. Lily's story had a lot to teach. I think I died a little when I realized that sometimes love is not enough. Regret  good will  they're not enough to fix some wounds. On the contrary  they make them deeper.  “Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action  the pain would be a little easier to bear.”  It Ends with Us is the most personal and daring and painful book Colleen Hoover has ever written. Abuse and domestic violence are a delicate subject  and when I found out they were this book's main theme I thought about not reading it. It was a moment of cowardice  a moment I didn't want to witness this side of relationships. But I owed it to myself  as a person and as a woman to proceed. Because pretending a problem doesn't exist does not make it disappear. There will be spoilers below so if you haven't read It Ends with Us  you should probably stop here.  “Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen.”   Naked truth coming. I was one of the people who don't understand. The people who  when they hear about abuse  the first thing that occurs to them is why doesn't she leave him? Why does she let her fear guide her  and she's so selfish that makes her children witness such horrors inside their home  that was supposed to be their sanctuary? But what we should ask is what is wrong with him? Instead of making excuses and trying to justify him  we should take a moment and consider how she feels  and the difficult decisions she has to make. Ryle broke my heart into millions of pieces. I fell in love with him  and I kept wishing that Colleen would delete these words  these scenes that hurt me and disappointed me and shattered my belief in happy endings. A part of me  a part I tried to smother  a part I am ashamed that exists  wanted him to change. To try harder  and for Lily to let him try harder. Me  who judged them for not leaving. In the end  I felt sorry for Ryle. For losing the love of his life  for destroying his only chance at happiness. I don't forgive him  I just wish that a magic wand would make everything better.  “So much gravity  pushing down on my emotions. Everything shatters.My tears  my heart  my laughter  my soul. Shattered like broken glass  raining down around me.”   Lily is a hero. She had dignity  and courage and strength. At first I was judging her mother for staying  but witnessing through Lily's eyes her challenges  feeling her heartbreak and her dilemmas  made me regret all the ugly things I thought. Loving the person who hurts you is a greater torture than the physical act itself. And damn it I loved Ryle  and I hated Colleen for that. I hated her for making me swoon and laugh when she was about to shatter my soul. The Katerina that started It Ends with Us is a different person than the Katerina that finished it. Remorseful  destroyed  wiser.  “Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it  so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday  or maybe even never.”   A part of me wants to forget this raw  powerful  inspirational  beautiful and ugly book. But the dominant part  even though it suffers  is glad I read it and learned.To every single person out there  READ IT.To every woman in Lily's place  BE BRAVE AND BOLD.To Colleen Hoover  THANK YOU. For sharing this with us. With me.  “Just keep swimming.”    ...more  ,

The fact that this story had so much basis on real life events that meant so much to her shined through in her writing. Clearly you can guess the ending of the story (to some degree) by the title  but a majority of what makes this story so breathtaking is the journey there. ""It Ends With Us"" caused me to look at domestic abuse in ways I never allowed myself to in the past. As a society we are quick to judge women (and men) who stay in abusive relationships without taking into account what the process really is like for them. We get a slight glimpse into the fragile situation of how incredibly difficult it is to leave a dangerous relationship when you love the person who is causing you harm. I won't say more for fear of ruining the reading experience for someone else  but this book was so much more than a flimsy romance novel. Highly recommended!

I call bullshit because this was masterful.If you have read this book and also follow my reviews  you know the topic of abuse is one I sort of talk about a lot. this book got it right. this book got it so  so right.  So let’s talk about why.  → character work ← I knew I would love Lily from the moment she stood up at her abusive father’s funeral and refused to speak. And oh boy  was I right. Lily works so well as a protagonist because she isn’t the archetype. She has been through abuse herself and she is so  so sure it would never happen to her. She would leave if even one thing happened. She would. ...But then she doesn’t. She reads as absolutely  totally real. And her character development? Fucking iconic.  → friendship focus ← Something that really bothers me a lot in romances like this is that a romance tends to save the protagonist  and I think this book - despite marketing that made me concerned this trope would rear its ugly head -  does the opposite.  The lead friendship here between Lily and Alys is so 20/10 and so important. And even though there is a touch of romance  I think the book is very explicit about it not being healthy for Lily to jump right into a new relationship. I appreciate that a lot.  → narrative treatment ← I think this is one of the only books I have ever read that actually seems to understand that  abuse is a mortal sin.  The wild thing is  aside from his moments of extreme rage  Rylin never appears to be that bad of a guy. He apologizes every time. He continuously seems to account for Lily’s feelings. But his actions against her are enough. There is no question in the narrative on whether she was being unempathetic: Lily was right to leave  no matter how he treated her in the aftermath. And I think that means a lot to me  how his character is nuanced but also irredeemable for Lily. I mean  aside from these three things  everything about this novel was basically good - the writing is extremely clean and easy-to-read  there are some really really funny moments  the romance that does end up occurring is genuinely sweet  and it's overall a win - but on a personal level? I am destroyed. This book is not just good  this book is Fantastic. and that's my opinion. goodnight. Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube ...more  ,

We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.” “I feel like everyone fakes who they really are  when deep down we're all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others.” ""I start shaking my head  wanting the last fifteen seconds to go away. Fifteen seconds.

9781471156267,0,"  “As hard as this choice is  we break the pattern before the pattern breaks us.”This is my first Colleen Hoover novel. So far I've stayed away from her books for several reasons. You might even call it prejudice  but my judgement didn't fail me. Here's why:First of all Colleen's ratings are mile high and I'm usually a little doubtful when it comes to that. I just have this feeling that this novel/author is very likely overrated.Second of all the plot synopsis of every single one of her books seem “As hard as this choice is  we break the pattern before the pattern breaks us.”This is my first Colleen Hoover novel. So far I've stayed away from her books for several reasons. You might even call it prejudice  but my judgement didn't fail me. Here's why:First of all Colleen's ratings are mile high and I'm usually a little doubtful when it comes to that. I just have this feeling that this novel/author is very likely overrated.Second of all the plot synopsis of every single one of her books seems - how do I say that without sounding mean? - boring. Uncreative. It's always the same in a way. Like Nicholas Sparks (who by the way is a huge homophobe which is the one big reason I'll never ever read one of his books or watch his movies) you know exactly what to expect. A pretty  white and probably starcrossed couple falling in love. Lots of melodrama. A few big shock moments here and there. You know what I'm talking about.The third reason: It's just so straight. And I love a fair share of gay. And I really don't care for straight sex scenes.About this book:Ah well sometimes even I am a slut for clichés and Colleen hits them all. She's a pro. So yes I rolled my eyes a during the first few pages when a tall  dark  hot stranger meets the main character on a rooftop in the middle of the night and they immediately share their deepest thoughts with each other. But secretly I also enjoyed it. I enjoyed their perfect lives and their luxury and the fact that a 24-year-old girl opened a successful and even revolutionary flower shop. I mean  sure why not.The characters seemed fine but the only one I really cared about was Atlas. He really seemed to have character depth while the others just fell a little flat. But then again this is not the kind of novel where I expect the characters to be complex.The names are just horrible. Gosh honestly  this is so typically American  such a white people thing. ""Let's just add an 'e' to my brother Rile's name and that's exactly what I'll call my daughter. Rilee."" ""I love Ellen Degeneres and Finding Nemo so my daughter's middle name will be Dory. And by the way  my name is Lily Blossom Bloom  nice to meet you."" Do I have to say more? Yup  my head hurts from rolling my eyes this much.Now this book tackles one big topic and it's called domestic violence and abusive relationships. And in my opinion  Colleen did a good job of portraying them. Of course  I have no experience with this particular matter so I can only judge it from the outside. But as the author explained in her afterword every (abusive) relationship is different and plays out differently. She herself wrote about a young woman's struggle to free herself from this violence. It wasn't an easy fight and she will probably have to fight it in the future. Of course  I wished for her to end it right when it started  but this often isn't the reality. Then again it's a book  which has the power to set an example for other men and women and it shouldn't even have gone this far. But then again it wouldn't have pictured the struggle a person faces when he or she experiences such violence. You see  this discussion could go on and on.In a nutshell: I didn't connect with any of the characters or got emotionally involved in any other way  but it's an entertaining book with a surprisingly deep turn.Find more of my books on Instagram ...more  ",

After all  how many people out there are actually interested in hearing about my own misadventures in the dating arena?On second thought  don't answer that.So when I started diving into It Ends with Us: A Novel by Colleen SPOILER FREE REVIEWAs a member of the human species with a Y chromosome  I admit that the allure of the romance novel eludes me  even though I'm a particularly hopeless romantic myself. The thought of reading about a prolonged courtship isn't something to get all excited about. After all  how many people out there are actually interested in hearing about my own misadventures in the dating arena?On second thought  don't answer that.So when I started diving into It Ends with Us: A Novel by Colleen Hoover  I expected pages of the same old trite that have filled thousands of romance novels ever since the first caveman dragged the first cavechick by the hair back into his stone-age pad. Wouldn't you know it? I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Let's take a brief rundown of the requisite elements and see if this novel has them:  	 Girl Meets Boy - CHECK  	 Boy is Impossibly Handsome - CHECK  	 Boy is Impossibly Rich - CHECK  	 Boy is Impossibly Talented - CHECK  	 Boy has Mysterious Name - CHECK  	 Boy is Emotionally Aloof - CHECK  	 Girl Tries To Deny Feelings For Boy She Just Met - CHECK  	 Boy Makes A Move - CHECK  	 Girl Pretends Not To Like It - CHECK  	 Boy Says Something Clever and Sexy - CHECK  	 Boy and Girl Have Wild  Raunchy Sex - CHECK  Okay  the last one actually doesn't happen for a good while owing to the tried-and-tested phone-call-interruption-just-when-we're-about-to-do-it cliche  but it's still there.Here's a description of when the two lovebirds first meet:I feel his voice in my stomach. That's not good. Voices should stop at the ears  but sometimes - not very often at all  actually - a voice will penetrate past my ears and reverberate straight down through my body. He has one of those voices. Deep  confident  and a little bit like butter.  Here's another one:This guy is beautiful. Well-manicured  smells like money  looks to be several years older than me. His eyes crinkle in the corners as they follow me  and his lips seem to frown  even when they aren't.Now  why would I give four stars to a book that overuses so many tropes?Because Colleen Hoover knows her audience so well it's almost criminal. Her writing is clean and lucid. The protagonist is fleshed-out. The story tugs at the heart. Everything else can be forgiven.And by the end of the first half of the book  it becomes painfully obvious that this novel is not about romance. It's about heartache.Our protagonist is a 23-year old wannabe florist named Lily Blossom Bloom (yes) who meets brooding neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (again  yes). Lily's father has recently passed  and she's trying to come to terms with her less-than-stellar relationship with dear ol' dad. Flashbacks are interspersed throughout the book via Lily's high school diary  and we quickly find out that her first love was a homeless guy named Atlas Corrigan (for the last time  yes) who lived in an abandoned shack near her childhood home. To say that dad and Atlas did not get along is an understatement.Lily is a smart and driven woman  and it shows through her personality. She balances the pleasures of love with the pleasures of work. A couple chapters in  she decides to pursue her dream and open a flower shop:""Sweet  life  pink  spring."" I repeat. And then  ""Allysa  you're brilliant!"" I stand up and begin pacing the floor. ""We'll take everything everyone loves about flowers  and we'll do the complete opposite!""Nice one  Lily.But of course  this wouldn't be a good novel if all we ever read about is how good Lily is getting it at the office and in the bedroom. Midway through  disaster strikes.I won't say what kind of disaster  but there's quite a few of it  both in present time and in the flashbacks. And then there's love. And then there's disaster. And then there's love. And then there's disaster. And then there's love.This book may overuse so many things we've come to expect of romantic comedies  but when I figured out the real message Colleen wanted to impart  I swept all the small things under the rug. This novel is a heartfelt plea for the readers to empathize with men and women who are caught up in relationships that are causing them turmoil and pain. It's a call to have an open mind when confronted with a similar relationship in the real world  both for the man  the woman  and their families. Finally  it leaves us with a beautiful if not sad moral lesson that the right thing to do may sometimes also be the hardest thing to do.People say that teenagers don't know how to love like an adult. Part of me believes that  but I'm not an adult so I have nothing to compare it to. But I do believe it's probably different. I'm sure there's more substance in the love between two adults than there is between two teenagers. There's probably more maturity  more respect  more responsibility. But no matter how different the substance of a love might be at different ages in a person's life  I know that love still has to weigh the same. You feel that weight on your shoulders and in your stomach and on your heart no matter how old you are.The book is peppered with phrases like the one above  and the more I read  the more I got the feeling that the words were coming from the author's mouth and not the protagonist's.At the beginning and end of the novel  there is a personal message left by the author  and the motivation for this book suddenly becomes clear. They say writing is a private and cathartic process  and for Colleen  this certainly was extremely private and cathartic. It must have taken a lot of effort to write. It's only fair that it took a lot of joy to read. ...more  ",

TRIGGER WARNING : (view spoiler)[It's a story of abuse and she is never with both guys at the same time. So not a triangle.  (hide spoiler)]--------------------------------------------FULL REVIEW ALL SPOILERS HAVE BEEN MARKEDIt breaks my heart a little to say this  but I think it's time I broke up with Colleen Hoover's books. Her first few books are some of my favorite books of all-time  but her latest have been very mediocre and not to mention  frustrating. I went into It Ends With Us with an open-mind  but I still found the book to be trite and I felt a little bad for feeling so meh about it given the context and background of the story.Let me get one thing out of the way. Colleen Hoover is talented. Ridiculously so. There's absolutely no doubt about that. Her writing is beautiful and evocative and she's an author with a ton of potential. However  I sincerely believe she hasn't explored her full potential yet. Maybe it's because she's writing too fast  but despite the topics that she's been handling lately  her books haven't been as strong as her debut series. My biggest complaint when it comes to It Ends With Us was how over the top it was. I get that people in real life have all kinds of issues  but if you're not going to give equal and considerate attention to each issue that you're tackling in a book  then it winds up just being messy. In It Ends With Us  EVERY single character had something seriously messed up happen to them. And I do mean EVERY. There's the homeless suicidal boy  the abusive parent  the boy who shot his brother in the brain when he was 6  the infertility issues and so much more. It's TOO much. It's almost as if the author decided to add all these topics to make the book forcefully emotional  like she tackled all of them just so readers find it an emotional tearjerker. If it had focused on the one big issue  it would have been a much much more powerful story  in my opinion. I have read books in the past that were simple in their writing but were all incredibly emotional and made me cry because of how subtly and beautifully they handled the one main topic that they explore. Taylor Jenkins Reid and Melina Marchetta are examples of two such authors who do this brilliantly.And I don't know guys  this book read very pretentious to me. I'm finding this to be a trend in Colleen Hoover's books lately. I mean just look at those names. Atlas? Ryle? Lily Bloom? I mean seriously? Some of those names are supposed to be funny  but they were very distracting and took away from the story for me. And then there are the letters to Ellen DeGeneres. The protagonist is a huge Ellen fan and addresses all her journal entries to Ellen. I'm a big Ellen fangirl  and I loved that Lily loved Ellen too  but ehh the journal writing felt a bit much for me. Oh and my personal favorite? (view spoiler)[ Lily names her daughter Dory after the freaking fish in Finding Nemo. Am I the only one who thinks this is just weird??  (hide spoiler)] There was also the cheesiness factor which was amped up like nobody's business. I can tolerate some amount of cheese  but this author takes it to a whole new level. The scenes between Lily and Atlas  especially were nauseating. (view spoiler)[Atlas who is homeless and secretly moves into the abandoned house next to Lily is just about to kill himself  when he decides not to because he sees the light in her bedroom and she looks like ""an angel"" who has come to save him or something. Is this supposed to be romantic???  (hide spoiler)] Don't get me wrong  they had some really good romantic scenes  but the whole story was bogged down by cliched lines.I'm also very annoyed at how misleading that summary is going to be for some readers. This is NOT a love triangle. (view spoiler)[I'm not sure why this book is being marketed as a love triangle  because it isn't one. In fact  this needs to come with a trigger warning because it tackles domestic abuse. It just feels like another ""ooh let us try to shock the readers by not mentioning one of the relationships is abusive"". I'll admit the abuse part of the story was handled well and it was clearly a very personal story to Colleen Hoover  but yet  I also felt like it disappeared with all the other issues. Honestly  I'm not even sure what Atlas' role was in this book. He seemed to be there as a consolation prize for Lily at the end once she got away from her abusive relationship. Sure we get to see them as teenagers falling in love  but we don't really get to see them reconnect afterwards and I was disappointed with that. Ryle being abusive was very clear from the first scene he was introduced. I do like how Colleen Hoover went about with his portrayal. It was subtle and felt very realistic. That's why I think this could have been really really good had it only focused on the domestic abuse that Lily underwent.  (hide spoiler)]So yeah  this review isn't very cohesive  I apologize for that  but my thoughts are definitely a mess when it comes to this book. If you're a Colleen Hoover fan  don't worry about my rating and review. Considering the fact that 99% of all the other reviews are 5 star ratings  I have no doubt that It Ends With Us  like every other book by the author  will be a tearjerker hit among her readers. I know this makes me sound like an utter snob  but I expect much much more from her books and just slapping together a bunch of tough issues isn't enough for me to want to give a book a high rating. ...more  ",

I honestly say this is my longest Colho reading because I putted it down several times. I got pissed! I screamed! I clenched my fists so hard! I cursed entire family tree of Ryle Kinkaid! I haven’t wanted to hire contact torturers to kidnap a character to give the punishment he’d highly deserved for so long. The things he did to Lily: the physical and emotional abuse he gave her were impossible for me to absorb. I felt breathless and I gave up several times. This book sledgehammered my heart and crushed my soul! I returned my reading because the beautiful love story between Atlas and Lily it’s like seeing sunshine through dark clouds and giving me the only hope I could hold. I honestly thought only reading the flashbacks to warm my heart!  What if they reconnected that night when they accidentally meet again at the restaurant. What if Lily went back after him instead of choosing a path with Ryle. That scenario made me so happy but it would never be the same without tremendous angst Colho threw at us because she is expert to bring our the dirties ugliest cries of regular human being! And without pain and suffer  so much sadness  we don’t feel like we read actual Colho story  do we? Never! This book is in development to adapt into screenplay! It’s so compelling to read this heart stabbing  soul sledgehammering story of this book without consuming tons of paper products to dry tears we may shed. I cannot imagine how the movie will affect me. But sometimes words hurt more than actions and I’m so sure there’s no screenwriter has ability to reflect all those emotions Colho made us feel during our reads.  So my advice: stock entire paper products from grocery stores  lock yourself sound proof room not to scare your neighborhood with your screams and howling sounds and give your entire concentration to this lyrical  insanely heartfelt story. It’s one of the most compelling  sad  sensational Colho book I hardly digest the emotional turmoil it gave me! But it’s worth to the pain. Especially that meaningful  sentimental  poetic ending melted my heart. ...more  ,

This book makes you happy and sad  it confuses you  breaks you  hurts you  makes you question yourself and your thoughts! Hell  it makes you question your own code of ethics. ”The reasoning is the hardest part of this. It eats at me  little by little  wearing down the strength my hatred lends to me.”It would be easy to judge; easy to sit on a high horse  but the way this is written  the way Colleen Hoover conveyed her feelings… It makes it impossible to go out of this book without acknowledging her POV  it makes it impossible not to think about it. I know the world is not white and black. I always knew that there are many shades of grey  but this book? It confronts you with the deepest grey and forces you to deal with it. It poses the simple question: What would I have done? And as usually  the simple questions of life are the hardest and most complicated to answer. ;-)”All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.”We all know what we SHOULD do in certain situations! What is expected of us  but when you’re actually in one of those situations? When feelings are involved? It’s not that easy anymore…I could be vague and probably continue like that forever but I won’t say more than this! It wouldn’t be fair to all the people who still want to read “It Ends With Us”. So all I’m saying is this:- This book is important! - I really liked Lily as a character and I admire her! (view spoiler)[She did the right thing in a very difficult situation and she was so  so  so brave to end her relationship with Ryle!!! It had to be done  for the sake of her child  she had not only to let go of him but also of her hatred for him. And to reach that point  to make that decision  to give her child the opportunity to have a father and to forgive him for what he did? THAT WOMAN IS STRONG!!! <333 She has all my love and being a mother myself who only wants the best for her child  I could understand her decision!  (hide spoiler)]- Atlas is a precious bean and I love that man! <3 (view spoiler)[   ”I close my eyes as I soak up the familiarity of him. His smell  his touch  his comfort. I’ve never understood how someone can be so rock solid  yet comforting. But that’s always how I viewed him. Like he could withstand anything  but somehow still feels the weight that everyone else carries.” (hide spoiler)]- I enjoyed the two different POVs from Lily. Her teenage diary entries and the current plot made this a really intriguing read. Sometimes it felt like there were two different Lily’s which dominated the story line and I guess in some way there were  because the years of experience made them two different people. - Alyssa was the best friend ever!!! <333 (view spoiler)[When she told Lily that as her brother’s sister she didn’t want her to leave him but that as her best friend she had to tell her that she HAD to leave him  I actually had tears in my eyes! I loved her for saying this! Because she knew that Lily couldn’t be with Ryle and she loved her enough to help her to make the right decision. And this even though Ryle was her brother!! It takes strength not to let those family bonds get in the way and Issa was a very strong character for sure.  (hide spoiler)]- The ending…. I’ll never get over it. (view spoiler)[I really liked Ryle at the beginning of the book but the first time he hit her  I already wanted her to leave him. To hit your wife is inexcusable  to hit her twice or three times? Unforgivable!  ”You are my wife. I’m supposed to be the one who protects you from the monsters. I’m not supposed to be one.”I really wish I would have found out why Ryle was the way he was  I mean I get that the death of his brother did something with him  but why could he be so nice and caring to his sister and his own child  but felt an urge to hit his wife? Just because he was angry and saw red? For me as an outsider this is kind of tough to understand. A Ryle POV might have helped to understand him better. I mean it was obvious he regretted what he did  that he knew it was wrong  that he wished he would have never done it and that he hated himself for it. But WHY????!!!! WHY  Ryle??!! I guess that’s the main reason why I’m still thinking about this book. I’m having a difficult time to understand his actions  but maybe I’m just overthinking it and he really had no control over what he did… I guess I’ll never know. (hide spoiler)]- Read it  but be warned! It’s not an easy read. Trigger warnings: (view spoiler)[domestic abuse  violence against women  abusive relationships  homelessness (hide spoiler)]Conclusion:This was an emotional and haunting read and totally not what I expected. It definitely kept me on my toes though. XD Colleen Hoover is a great author and I’ll continue to read her other books.

It certainly isn’t like any other novel Colleen Hoover has written. The word ‘DIFFERENT’ is just etched into its very essence. I feel like Colleen put part of her story and her soul on a silver platter for us to observe and draw our own conclusions from it and this also became evident within the Author’s Note which  by the way  I wholeheartedly encourage you to read. Hell  no. Scratch that. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ IT ENDS WITH US. Not because of the hype. Not because of the romance. Not because of Colleen’s awesome writing skills. But because of the message. I cannot guarantee you’ll love it. I’m definitely far from loving it and I don’t even think it’s Colleen’s best work. This is the second book that’s ever made me feel the ‘I-love-it-but-I-hate-it’ vibes  the first being Dusty. I rated that one with 3 stars because based on my logic 1 star equals hate and 5 stars equate to love so the average of 3 will do. But I rated IEWU with a full 5 stars rating because if there’s one word to describe this book  then it’s EMPOWERING. And WOMEN EMPOWERMENT deserves 5 stars any given day. Plus  its unraveling is perfect.Without being spoilery  I will say this: this book is heavy. This book knifes your heart and twists it until you bleed all your pre-conceived ideas about certain topics straight out the window. I loved Lily. I loved Ryle. But most of all  I loved Lily & Ryle. Their relationship is so complex and layered and I was overwhelmed with feelings at just how perfect they were together. I laughed  I smiled  I felt my heart catch wings and head into the clouds. And then I cried buckets. Then there’s Atlas  which I did not fall in love with  but he just fit the puzzle perfectly and after a while I found him so lovable as well. And yes  I loved Lily & Atlas too. They were like a weak but brilliant rainbow after a storm. “In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.”  Now  now  don’t rush and believe this is some love triangle. I just feel evil now and I will say that YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA MUHAHA. *sobs*I’m not saying more because you should definitely head in blind with this one  as I did. Honorary mentions are needed  however: Alyssa  I swear  she’s the best friend I could possibly imagine; I cannot comprehend how difficult it must have been to say and do some things considering the unique dynamics of her with the other characters; Marshall was another great addition that simply showed how easily men can empower women too; and Lily’s mother is a glorious character. And I will share this: there was one particular scene that left me crying like there’s no tomorrow. The last hospital scene. That beautiful and so very ugly and just 100% gut-wrenching scene. Where decisions were made in the hopes of a better future. Where letting go was worth the love you’ve built piece by piece. Where the cycle of history stopped. Where I had to put the book down and start a sobfest. It gutted me  completely and utterly gutted me.  “And as hard as this choice is  we break the pattern before the pattern breaks us.” I read this book in 5 hours. I finished it 24 hours ago. I still can’t stop thinking about it and my stomach is still churning like ashes have taken residence there. I’m an emotional mess. I feel unsatisfied  yet content. Enraged  yet peaceful. This book shows the good  the bad  the in-between. It shows life and love and hatred. It shows how love can become a poison. It shows how love can shackle and hurt  but also save and heal. Honestly  it blew my mind. It doesn’t matter that it made me uncomfortable or that it made me wish things ended up differently. This story needed to exist exactly as it is no matter how broken my heart feels. It is brave and bold.It’s an eye-opener. I realized upon reading that I might have been indifferent or dismissive or downright judgmental regarding some statistics (this sounds weird  I know  but you’ll get it once you read). I never fully grasped some scenarios or some perspectives  but It Ends With Us changed that. It changed me  undoubtedly. And for that  thank you  Colleen. Thank you  Lily.

I don't remember much of the first book (Ugly Love)  but I'm aware that I loved it. I think I'll read it again soon  to refresh things.Then  I read the book ""Confession."" That's where I fell in love. And strongly. I don't know if you read my review of this book  but if so  I guess you can notice how much this book has affected me.Anyway  the name ""Colleen Hoover"" was engraved in my head  and I came to the decision that I wanted to read more of her books. I admit I didn't really know which book to pick up  so I did it randomly. I have to admit  the impression I got about this book from the description is not wow. But if that's what I got  then whatever.Now I thank my random choice  and big time.Like I said  this book fooled me.I was sure at the beginning that it was such a nice love book. Oh  how wrong I was.Continuing  I realized how amazing Colleen Hoover is  how fascinating this book is  and how important the message and meaning is.This isn’t a book that tells only about love  it is a book about the lives of quite a few women in the world who have experienced it.The plot talks about Lily  a sweet girl who tried hard to rearrange her life.At the beginning of the book  she meets Ryle  a smart  handsome  assertive neurosurgeon. And he really likes Lily.They manage to connect and get to know each other with their secrets. They call it ""naked truth."" The extraordinary truths and familiarity brought them to life together. But how can you forget the sweet guy from Lily's past?Atlas is an absolutely exceptional guy. The book bounces you between the past  written from Lily's diary  to the present. In her diary  Lily talks about Atlas  a child without a home  without a family. Lily helps Atlas  she sneaks him to her house  lets him take a shower  gives him clothes  watch TV together  eat  talk  get to know each other. The connection between them is definitely special. But I guess everything has an end- or... doesn't it?When Lily and Ryle enter an upscale restaurant  Lily encounters Atlas  after so many years  and discovers that he has managed to create and bring his life to a good place.Sounds like a cliche love story to you  right?So it's not.I don't want to do spoilers  so I would be very careful. it’s a book about strong love  with problems that quite a few women get into a cruel situation. There are women who manage to take their feet and walk  and some do not.Our main character  Lily  who is indeed a special hero for me  is going through jolts  ups and downs. Will her love succeed in overcoming logic? Or could logic make it better for her love? You know  a lot of people tend to say  ""Oh  come on  to me it won't happen  I'll never get to that.""Well  it might not. But it can be. Whether it's a man or a woman - whether you're on the violent or innocent side. You can get into that kind of situation. We all can.This is a book that should reach a wide audience - men  women  adults and more. This is a book that teaches a terribly important lesson in life.You know  I learned about that in psychology and sociology. Freud talked about it - it's called a defense mechanism.This is a situation where the person starts to make a “rationalization”. It operates by the subconscious mind. The person may even not be openly aware of it  but only in the subconscious. It is very difficult  and I can talk about it for hours  but I can’t do it here lol.To sum up  that’s why this book is so important.So of course I highly recommend this book. Have a good read  my loves. ...more  ",

I expected I would love every page of this  but I only marked 4 poems. This just was nothing new. The concepts in this poem  especially when it rolled around to the feminism aspects  just didn't wow me. An entire poem just about ""you don't NEED a man you WANT a man"" was just a repeat of things I've been hearing for years. It wasn't interesting  and a lot of the poems just sounded so pretentious because it was just plain text with no punctuation and random skips in the lines being fed to the reader as art. Someone mentioned this was a little too ""Tumblr "" and I agree. It was a quick read  but just a little bit frustrating because it was too simple  too familiar. The art was nice and a few of the poems were well-written  but for the most part  it seems like very little effort was put into this  which makes me sad because that's such a mean criticism for an artist who puts so much emotion into her work. ...more  ",

Is this what people think of poetry nowadays? Granted  Milk and Honey did tackle a lot of tough subjects like abuse  heartbreak  and self-healing  but the poor quality of writing distracted from the message.Some of the verses were outright laughable: when i am sadi don’t cry i pourwhen i am happyi don’t smile i glowwhen i am angryi don’t yell i burn And this one is just too good: the goddess between your legsmakes mouths water Did you really just call women's reproductive organs a ""goddess""? I'm still cracking up.Also  why is this book so against women shaving? It acts like men hate hairy women but do you really think the average man sits around thinking  ""I would totally date her  but she has leg hair."" And don't feed me that ""beauty standards are oppressing women"" lie. No one is forcing women to go to the store  buy a razor  and shave. I shave because I like my legs to feel smooth. If you feel like your body hair empowers you  go you. If you feel like smooth skin empowers you  go you. I don't want to hear about it either way.The truly sad thing about Milk and Honey is the author actually made some good points. Take this verse about women putting other women down: other women’s bodiesare not our battleground This is a serious issue that could have inspired a beautiful poem with a powerful message  but instead  the author wrote two lines that once again made me feel like I was browsing a teen girl's tumblr page.

Milk and Honey  is about happiness and despair  hurt and joy  love and sadness  and finding the strength to overcome your struggles. It is at times erotic  poignant  empowering  harrowing  and a celebration of all of the amazing qualities of women. Divided into four chapters—the hurting  the loving  the breaking  and the healing—each deals with a different step in relationships  both with someone else and with yourself.most importantly lovelike it's the only thing you know howat the end of the day all thismeans nothingthis pagewhere you're sittingyour degreeyour jobthe moneynothing even mattersexcept love and human connectionwho you lovedand how deeply you loved themhow you touched the people around youand how much you gave themSome of the poems are accompanied by small illustrations. I'd imagine that the print version of this book would make a beautiful gift for someone; I'm not sure if I missed out on something reading it on my Kindle  because I'm not 100 percent sure if each separate page is a separate poem or if the book is just laid out strangely. (I am also not quite sure if only some of the poems have titles or if each poem has its title at the end  meaning the stanzas between titled pages represent one poem.)Kaur is an absolutely dazzling writer. Her words evoke emotion  sexuality  femininity  anger  and hope. While perhaps some of this resonates more for women than for men  I still found this incredibly touching  incredibly moving  incredibly motivating  and at times simply breathtaking.you might not have been my first lovebut you were the love that madeall the other lovesirrelevantThis collection won't be for everyone. You need to be willing to put aside conventional notions of punctuation  capitalization  and the way sentences are divided. But more than that  you need to be willing to be vulnerable  to listen to Kaur's messages  and feel the feelings she is trying to convey. If you can do that  you will be richly rewarded by the beauty of  Milk and Honey .See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com  or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html. ...more  ,

Actually  the book felt a lot like going through a writer's Instagram feed if that makes any sense.

WE ALL HAVE THAT WEIRD 3AM POST FRIEND.)THE PRINCESS SAVES HERSELF IN THIS ONE is written in a very similar style to this  and I reluctantly gave that book 3 stars because it felt genuine  and maybe even authentic  even if it was written in a style that I didn't like and felt juvenile. MILK AND HONEY  I'm sure  comes from authentic emotions and experiences as well  and while I can appreciate someone wanting to share those experiences and use poetry to heal  I  as a reader  am in no way obligated to like said poetry just because the intent behind it was important. If ""intent"" was enough to get five stars  the star rating system would be pointless  because I'm pretty sure most writers publish their books with the intent of success and acclaim.MILK AND HONEY comes across as pretentious and unpolished - a dichotomy that should not be possible  and yet  in MILK AND HONEY  it is. The book also features some incredibly gross metaphors like ""the goddess between your legs / makes mouths water"" and ""the very thought of you / has my legs spread apart / like an easel with a canvas / begging for art."" Ughhhh  noooo. I can only imagine that the popularity from this poetry comes from accessibility and the format that seems so easy to copy that any young aspiring poet probably takes one look and goes  ""oh  if this dreck can be published  maybe my dreck can be published  too!"" The drawings are no better  ugly even  and look like napkin scribbles rather than actual art.I didn't like this at all. Everything in it has been said before. I could write a longer review ranting more about taste  expectations  and Shel Silverstein  but I'm trying to cut back on swearing and brusqueness in reviews  so I don't think any more negativity is necessary.

The book opens with what readers of religious texts  the erowid archives and Huxley's The Doors of Perception will recognise as a classic mystical experience  epiphany or trip: ""One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday  I woke up in the early hours with a feeling of absolute dread... `Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself  there must be two of me: the `I' and the `self' that `I' cannot live with."" ""Maybe "" I thought  ""only one of them is real.""... I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I was fully conscious  but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what seemed like a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at first and then accelerated. I was gripped by an intense fear  and my body started to shake. I heard the words ""resist nothing "" as if spoken inside my chest. I could feel myself being sucked into a void... Tears came into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room. I recognized the room  and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it before. Everything was fresh and pristine  as if it had just come into existence. I picked up things  a pencil  an empty bottle  marveling at the beauty and aliveness of it all."" After this experience  Ulrich Tolle became a vagrant mystic for a period  rechristened himself Eckhart (presumably after 13th century Christian mystic Meister Eckhart) and eventually became a spiritual teacher  author and talk-show guest with extraordinary success. The primary thesis of the book is quite sensible  if unshattering. We exist only in the present; our past and the future are mental constructs. It is a shame that our enjoyment of the present is so often ruined by regrets about the past and worries about the future. By being more intensely focused on the present  we can be more content and more fulfilled. As this doesn't fill 229 pages we are treated to  among other things  lengthy discourses on the ""pain-body""  an interesting theory of menstrual flow as a means to enlightenment and the surprising finding that as a member of the human race  I carry personal complicity and responsibility for all crimes and genocides of the twentieth century including those carried out before my birth. The style is generally chatty  though Eckhart occasionally uses a faux-dialectic to bring up obvious objections to his line of thought  to which he responds with withering scorn. One helpful feature is the use of a pause symbol (§) to indicate points at which ""you may want to stop reading for a moment  become still  and feel and experience the truth of what has just been said"". The text is interspersed with brief analyses of quotations from various religious traditions  apparently garnered from many weeks studying fridge-magnets. §I am glad to have read the book  if only to have gained a greater understanding of contemporary popular New Age/spiritual literature. If this book changed your life  please do not attack me but have compassion for my ligatures to mind and pain-body which impede my understanding of it.___This is (unfortunately) one of my most-liked reviews. I'd just like to add that I don't automatically hate all writing on these themes. I would warmly recommend Zen Mind  Beginner's Mind (Shunryu Suzuki)  The Miracle of Mindfulness (Thich Nhat Hanh) and The Courage to Be (Tillich) among others. ...more  ",

I made it until about half of the book when I realized I really could take no more of this rubbish. Mr Tolle preaches his ""wisdom"" (which is not actually his at all) with a condescending  ""I-know-it-all"" attitude. He is the only one enlightened (of course). We are all only to listen to his truths and follow on a ""as is"" basis. No thinking of your own is allowed. Actually  thinking is bad for you  so should be used sparingly anyway. If you disagree with any of his points  he just haughtily replies that ""you don't understand""  ""this cannot be accessed with your mind"" etc etc. He regularly reminds you that you are the one belonging to the horrible human species that kill millions of others. I agree with that - but I wonder why he thinks of himself as someone who is above those ugly humans? What  is he so much of a ""Being"" now that his ancestor's sins don't concern him? The next step will be to call him God and bring him your money because it's too materialistic for you anyway :) And actually it's not a joke - when you see how many people aggressively defend his ""great teachings"" and attack anyone who does not agree about the ""incredible spiritual value"" of this book... well  does that remind you of something?The basic ideas of this book - being in the now  not dwelling too much on your past and future  not giving too much power to your thoughts - are of course all highly relevant. But there are plenty of other books delivering the same message in much better style. Tolle is repeating the same things over and over again  mixing them up with bits and pieces of various religions and teachings. All that he had to say could be said in a couple of pages. But then again  writing a whole book is much better because you get to sell it to a lot of people. And although time may be an illusion  money for sure isn't ;) Do yourself a favour and read something else if you want to learn the power of now. A collection of simple meditations made me feel much more present and at peace than this boring mumbo-jumbo. ...more  ",

I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for the real meaning of their lives and to anyone who is sick and tired of the usual thing. The first time I encountered this book was when Oprah was introducing her book club selection  a new earth. I heard her mention this and while I was searching in the online catalog of our school library here in the Philippines I found it available for borrowing. So I immediately read it in the course of five days. After reading it the first time I understood its message intellectually. This was the reason why I didn't apply it in my life. But a few days ago I started having panic attacks and I was on the verge of suicide. I was so frustrated because I made a wrong decision in shifting my courses here in my school. I was so depressed because I didn't really know what I wanted with my life. It seems that the world is so full of shit. When this became worse I consulted our school counselor. However it seems that it is not enough. So without any real reason at all I started watching Oprah's videos about A New Earth and I remembered this book. I borrowed it again yesterday and just awhile ago I finished reading it. Then I began to understand it not on the level of the mind but at the level of the spirit. And without incident I became enlightened. I am still starting to feel its benefits at this moment. I started accepting what is rather than identifying myself with the ego. I can't say that I'm happy after reading this book like some ""self-help"" books would like you to be. But I can say that I am at peace because I aware of the workings of the ego and not identified with it. So if you've had enough of the madness of this world I definitely recommend this book.

I expected more  but he sits right in there with Deepak Chopra as a prime examples of other equally useless anti-science hokum. I don’t usually torture myself with such media excretions.Tolle is kind of cultish. Worse  he uses scare tactics stating we’re all in some kind of race to obliterate the human ego and the “pain-body” before they destroy the earth. The ‘ticking clock’ once again…horse manure. We are our egos. We hold memories of pain for a good reason–to avoid repeating mistakes. That's how we evolved from our ape ancestors. And all his arguments fall down in exactly the same way as every other new-age guru I've ever read with the classic '3 card trick' as a means of argument:1. ""The Higher Level Card"" (i.e. sorry  it's just over your head). Sorry  but you're just not clever enough to realise Eckhart is cleverer than you  because you're on a lower (less divine/lower psychic vibration) level.2. ""The Projection Card"" (i.e.  I know you are  but what am I?). By criticising Eckhart  you are really just criticising yourself  because any problem you see in Eckhart/the world at large is just a projection of a problem in yourself.3. ""The Skillful Means Card"" (i.e.  it's all your own fault  idiot!). The most potent card of all. It's not abuse; it's not pathetic or ridiculous or wrong; it's a crazy to wise teaching method. So when Eckhart calls you an idiot  it's not because he's an pompous idiot  it's because you have a idiot-complex that you need to evolve past  and he's here to help you see that!It's just not healthy to read books like this. This dualistic zen-style thinking just doesn't hold water in the real world. Then there's the Eckhart Tolle “walk of death.” Allegedly after listening to Tolle’s Power of Now tapes repeatedly  Brianna Wilkins walked miles without warm clothing (thinking only of the present moment  I’m sure) in the middle of winter and…”Now ” she’s dead.Humans are not broken  they're mostly just confused. We may not know ourselves so well  but we’re operating exactly as nature intended. We’re greedy  competitive  with a short attention span  seeking instant gratification. But we’re also kind  long-suffering  generous  wise  and empathetic–with the two camps always in conflict within each of us. Solutions to human problems will come from realist introspection  critical thinking  rationality and acknowledging of the darkness  e.g. more rationality and less mysticism. We can start that process right here  right now–with our egos and pain-memories intact–not in some future idealised fantasy world. Change won’t come overnight but occurs through an evolutionary process. That’s what else ticks me off about the Tolle: he dresses it up in the conceit of spirituality  but actually panders to the very ordinary materialistic drive towards the “quick fix ” the effortless “new you.” Well  you don’t get something for nothing. Or much for £10! :)Apologies if this is ranty - but this was a terrible  self-absorbed  arrogant  pompous book. Avoid. ...more  ",

He did have several good points  such as not spending so much time worrying and thinking about the things that have already and have not happened yet. We do need to be more mindful of ourselves in the Now... really pay attention to our actions and the kinds of thoughts we have. Once we recognize a harmful pattern we can have the awareness to change those aspects of ourselves.

(Its no surprise why every author wants Oprah to recommend their book).So lets start my review. Yes folks  My gazillion dollar book review that may be only 300 people per day may read. The big emphasis is on the word ‘may’.Overview:The author tries to give an explanation into topics like:Life in the Now.Ego & Non Ego EnlightenmentThe Manifested & Not ManifestedTransformation & Just being.(not exactly in that order but that a small nutshell)So that’s about it. Now starts my Book Review.People like Deepak Chopra  Echkart Tolle  Joe Vitale should either be spanked until their bottoms become permanently so sore  that they should never be able to sit on their rear end or they should be hung upside down covered in a pile of stinking poo until they promise never to waste peoples time with their ‘woo-woo’ nonsense. All Echkart Tolle has tried to do is splatter some spiritual words  some hard to define concepts  mixed it up with some logical confusion  lots of mumbo-jumbo  defined and twisted words  peppered it with mysticism  cooked it up with some crack pot experience  sliced it with some anecdotes and repeated the same concept is so many different ways – you will assume you are enlightened in the end  simply because your brains are either fried or numb with nonsense. I mean in a world filled with people who are illogical and confused about the god myth  to the different kinds of gods and different versions of gods  you bring some cocaine induced neutral sounding deep nonsense and the next thing you know – everyone is holding hands  closing their eyes and feeling the warmth of the spirit flow through them – which is nothing but BS!!!I hated the book right from the time I read the first few lines. If you thought Wayne Dyer was nuts and Deepak Chopra was off his Cuckoo  then Echkart is on steroids of Self Delusion. What a bloody waste of money  time and space these people are with their nonsense. I think people should wake up  get real and stop following these woo-woo teachers with their nonsensical philosophies. Personally  he may appeal to a bunch of lost idiots on our planet (and I am sure there are many of them)  but I’m sorry  I am not part of that mumbo-jumbo-om-chanting-peace-flowing-spiritual-seeking-delusional-club.

My consciousness isn't evolved enough to know absolutely for sure one way or the other.There are some very useful concepts in this book for me  presented in a very useful way. None of them are new  and E. Tolle says as much. The more I learn about the great wisdom teachings the more they seem to me to be the same  harmonious with each other. So  he is just adding his voice to the harmony.The way Tolle presents the teachings make intuitive sense to me and helps me make use of them. Your mind wants you to think it is in charge  don't be fooled. Be aware of your emotions  they provide interesting guidance and input. There is no reality but the present moment  everything else is either a memory about the past or a fantasy about the future.I would hang out with Eckhart Tolle  and reading his books might be as close as I'll ever get.

If you already have a good grounding in spritual wisdom  you can probably pick out the good stuff from the nonsense. But if you already know the good stuff  why waste your time on this? And I can see how some uninformed people could be misled. So I really can't recommend the book to anyone. But there are some good things. Here are some examples:The Good: Direct all thoughts towards the present moment. Don't dwell on mistakes of the past or anxiety about the future.Meditation is good.Tap your subconscious for creativity.Self-awareness (being able to observe and reflect on your thinking and emotions as they occur) can be a powerful tool.Our ego gets in our way a lot.The Bad:All spiritual truth can be found inside yourself (he writes quite a long book and does a lot of lectures and workshops for him to really believe that)A number of misleading scientific ""examples""  especially concerning animals and spacetime (pages 24  34  99  137-140)False interpretation of religious texts  especially the gospels (such as pages 95  101  105)Promotes belief in reincarnationThe Ugly:""The pain-body consists of trapped life-energy that has split off from your total energy field and has temporarily become autonomous through the unnatural process of mind identification.""""You haven't yet grasped the essence of what I am saying because you are trying to understand it mentally. The mind cannot understand this. Only you can. Please just listen.""""In this way  you grow in presence power. It generates an energy field in you and around you of a high vibrational frequency. No unconsciousness  no negativity  no discord or violence can enter the field and survive """"Even a stone has rudimentary consciousness; otherwise  it would not be  and its atoms and molecules would disperse. Everything is alive.""""Consciousness is evolving throughout the universe in billions of forms. So even if we didn't make it  this wouldn't matter on a cosmic scale. No gain in consciousness is ever lost  so it would simply express itself through some other form. But the very fact that I am speaking here and you are listening or reading this is a clear sign that the new consciousness is gaining a foothold on the planet.""* Something I don't understand. In his story  he was utterly despondent and suicidal  then was fixed by a brilliant moment of enlightenment  and woke up in the morning happy and joyful. What does this book have to do with his own spiritual awakening? He seems to say that some people were ""lucky"" and fixed in a moment like him  while others have to work for it. But what makes him the authority on working towards enlightenment  when he's one of the people who didn't have to do it?Also  he is quite egotistical for a spiritual authority. He has a very outsized view of how ""enlightened"" he is compared to everyone else and how greatly the world will benefit from his personal work. ...more  ",

As a young man  Eckhart was all about the mind/intelligence. During the time he was a student one of his professors  who's mind he admired greatly up and committed suicide - undoubtedly due to the pressure he and others put on him. This puzzled Eckhart. How could such an intelligent person choose to end their life?This he put aside  as we all do  and went back inside his head and his anxieties. Then one night he woke up with an overwhelming sense of dread and anxiety. But instead of taking the same route as his professor took  he heard someone or something say ""accept everything""  and that's what he did. Just then he felt like he was sucked into a void  just nothing at all. When he woke up in the morning everything seemed brand new and fantastic......and he new all the stuff he put in this book.This book is full of good stuff such as....Nothing ever happened in the past  and nothing will happen in the future. Everything that happens only happens right now......so dwelling on it or worrying about it just messes with your head  so try not to do it.If you find yourself in an intolerable situation  you have three options. Remove yourself from it. If you can't do that  change it. If you can't do either  accept the situation completely (at least for now). Because bitching about it does no good.There is more good stuff  so read the book if you want to know.There are also lots of silly new agey terms like ""Pain body""  which is unfortunate since your too busy chuckling to take the serious stuff serious  but I really liked this book and got a lot of good information from it. ...more  ",

What I didn't like:I didn't like the style of him answering questions that people pose to him. Just because you answer a question  it doesn't mean the answer makes any sense! I hate his cocky attitude. I think it's great that he found inner peace and he's trying to help others  but come on he's not a prophet or a god. He espouses such lofty claims without any scientific or even logical evidence  insists they are universal facts of the world  and hides behind a lot of new age mumbo jumbo. I guess you have to be confident about any opinion you have to be taken seriously (the follow the leader mentality)  but honestly I didn't like his tone at all  and thought he was condescending in a way that made little sense to me. Also  he didn't really give that much practical advice. All of the advice was about theoretical mindsets that people might have.If he was my therapist I would go even crazier. My biggest problem with this book  is the apologetic stance it takes on abuse. Whether that is abuse from your spouse  parents  friends  or strangers he claims that you shouldn't be mad  because ""they could not have done anything else"". What kind of fatalist BS is that? Imagine if a therapist told that to a rape victim! It kind of reminds me of the stance taken in ""Radical Forgiveness""  but at least that book acknowledges the issue of not staying in a toxic environment  this just throws the whole thing out the window!As a whole  I don't think this book is horrible  but he makes such strange claims that it becomes a religion on its own. The fact that Jesus and God are just misunderstood concepts for millennia and we should look at what the spirit is  or that he believes the spirit lives on but not in an afterlife? What does that even mean? Since human civilization came to be  people have been looking for the meaning of life  and I don't feel any closer to it from reading this book  despite him claiming to have all of the answers. I think people like this book because it fits into a mold of what we would want an ideal religion to be like. Something that encourages love and acceptance of all people and to be at constant peace. While I think that is a great life motto to live by  I don't think the particular beliefs he pushes are in any way rational  and just because something is appealing on an emotional level  it doesn't mean that it makes any kind of intellectual sense. ...more  ",

If you disliked this book  you may enjoy having some company in your opinion. --Betsy RobinsonThe Review (November 18  2018)Normally I would not finish let alone review a book I disliked as much as I did this one  but since I bought the book and am reading it for my book club  I’ve decided to say what I think:I found the writing of this romance/murder mystery to be painfully split—almost as if there were two different authors: an experienced one for the vivid narrative and an amateur for dialogue and character development (which in fact may be the case  since the author’s an experienced nature writer and this is her first novel).The story is told in two time periods: Young Kya  left alone in the marsh to fend for herself  starts the story in 1952; and police investigate a murder in 1969. The opening lyrical descriptions of the swampland and inner thoughts of the swamp kids had soul—I loved  felt  and smelled the land  sea  air  and dense plants. But when people started talking  the writing became stilted  overwritten  and unbelievable. This happened in the earlier time period with Kya and a boy and the boy and his dad  and same thing with the 1969 police dialogue. The kids’ scenes had an after-school TV special sound and the police scenes sounded canned  like a marshlands-of-North Carolina version of Law and Order  where exposition is awkwardly inserted to move the story forward or there is overwriting that takes away from what could have sounded more authentic to the region. For example  a deputy says to his sheriff:“I’m hungry. Let’s go by the diner on the way out there.” “Well  get ready for an ambush. Everybody in town’s pretty riled up. Chase Andrew’s murder’s the biggest thing’s happened ’round here  maybe ever. Gossip’s goin’ up like smoke signals.”“Well  keep an ear out. We might pick up a tidbit or two. Most ne’er-do-wells can’t keep their mouths shut.”(61)Why not just  “I’m hungry ” and cut to the wonderful description of the Barkley Cove Diner and the scene of people gossiping about the crime? In real life  people do not say everything they’re thinking or narrate everything that’s happening or is going to happen. In fact  most of us lie about what we really think—if we are even self-aware enough to know our subconscious thoughts. Leaving out thoughts  leaving gaps in truth  and trusting the characters a writer has created allows subtext and real character to drive things forward. There is none of that here.I found the character development absurd: Simply put  there are no authentic  complex characters. Kya starts as a believable swamp rat  which is inconsistent with what we learn about the derivation of her parents. Her voice is unbelievably inconsistent throughout the book. Then there are the two one-dimensional romances  one of which allows her to learn to read at age 14 and grow into an educated  sophisticated  poetry-reciting biologist  knowing lyrics to songs she never would have heard  etc.  and the other  a sexual relationship where she doesn’t even think about getting pregnant although she seems to have learned all her biology from the esoteric scientific texts she reads.I finished this book by skimming large sections  starting at page 164 when the entire plot became apparent  sans an end-of-book twist which was intellectually fun  but just as unbelievable as the manipulations of Kya’s character. Sorry  friends who adore this book  I’m an outlier on this one  I guess. ...more  ,

She lives on the outskirts of town  in the Marsh  and the locals look down their noses at her  she is judged  ridiculed and bullied. But there are those who show her kindness  friendship  and show her love. Oh  how I loved this book!Kya was a young girl when her Mother walked away without looking back. Soon  all her siblings followed suit  leaving Kya alone with her often absent  drunk  and abusive father. She is left to care for their home  to cook  clean and take care of both of their needs. How her situation pulled on my heartstrings. She had to learn to shop  to cook and to provide food for herself in her father's absence. All while dealing with loneliness  feelings of abandonment and loss. Always wondering when and if her Mother will ever return. She was a smart and clever girl who knew the marsh and found ways to make money and provide for her basic needs. Soon 'Jumpin and his wife  Mable  show her kindness  generosity and love. I dare you not to adore this couple!As Kya grows and learns more about life through her interactions with the creatures of the Marsh  two young men enter her life. One is her brother's older friend  Tate  who teaches her to read and shows her acceptance and happiness. Another brings her hope of a future but won’t introduce her to his friends and family. Could one be her chance at happiness? A chance at belonging? A chance at being accepted? A chance at being loved? A Chance for growth? Or will history repeat itself?In 1969  local football legend  Chase Andrews is found dead. Rumors swirl as to motive and possible suspects. Rumors have been circulating for years about Chase and his involvement with the Marsh girl. Could she be his killer? What motive could she have?This book had a little bit of everything that I love: a likeable main character who pulls at your heartstrings  murder mystery  atmosphere  drama  coming of age  and romance. There are several characters who give and show kindness including  Tate  the cashier who gives back too much change and the couple who make sure Kya has what she needs. What is the saying? Those that have the least to give  give the most! There is a police investigation and court room drama and some twists and turns I did not see coming.This book is beautifully written and contains poetry and vivid descriptions of the Marsh. I highly recommend this book! It's thoughtful  evokes emotion  and transports the reader back in time to the Marsh. I loved every page. Read more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com ...more  ,

Mother Nature has literally become Kya’s caretaker  and deep in a lonely Marsh along the North Carolina coast is where Kya will not only hide  but blossom into a primal independent being  coaxed inside the loyal embrace of an indiscriminate wilderness as she embodies its uninhibited spirit. Until a young boy from “yonder” befriends Kya  and her lonely existence is shaken straight to its solemn core. Add to that the curious unsolved murder of the town’s local “Golden Boy”  and all that’s left to say is GAME. ON. Although this story delivers one hell of a  powerful  punch  it is sculpted with quite a humble hand; a delicate wind that keeps building and building until it ends up emphatically blowing your mind. The writing.  The Writing …Prose so unique; so breathtaking; so utterly beautiful that a single description of a firefly suddenly grows so intimate and probing  and I might have gotten something in my eye—*sniff*. Here you’ll find sentences that read like poetry  with a lyrical rhythm that sways the reader like the gentle rocking of a boat. Yet it is not showy nor over-the-top --- but perfect. Owens doesn't tell us what to think  but alludes to each message through writing so alive you can almost hear it breathing. She carries us through her dense  atmospheric tone and persuades us to seek and find; discover and examine  all on our own. She allows her striking imagery to guide us as the marsh has guided Kya  and I felt as though I could smell the sea and taste the sweetness of new love. Kya’s journey spans years  the reader present from her childhood into maturity. I love this story’s ode to wilderness and Mother Earth with all her glorious wonder; her instinctual need to nurture and protect. I love each character’s flawed nature as well as those redeemed. I love the heart and soul that saturates every inch of this story  and more than anything  I LOVE that spectacularly bold ending! There were a few tedious moments where I thought this story might begin to drag and possibly not live up to its hype  but I was wrong  and this story was SO right. To the reader who appreciates nature’s effortless beauty honored in fiction; to those who seek a love story every bit true as it is tender; to the one who needs a tantalizing murder/mystery to spice things up  and for those who tend to root for the underdog in hopes she’ll someday sparkle like the gem she is—this one’s for you.  *Traveling Friends Read*  ...more  ,

When you listen to this book  you feel like the story is narrated by nature…The swamp  the trees  all those rare kinds of birds  breezing wind  wild animal’s roaring…That’s all out there and you can hear them  smell them  imagine them in your mind… It’s so alive  realistic  rejuvenating!So this book is about hate  abandonment  neglect  reject to accept the differences of other people.A little girl tries to stay alive on this wild nature but old those wild  unpredictable  dangerous creatures of nature never scared her. The ruthless people who are adamant to hurt  humiliate  insult her were the real threat she needed to protect from.She feels alive by communicating with the birds because they cannot hurt them with their words  they cannot humiliate her with insulting words. They just fly freely and travel around the world as she is stuck in the swamp and gets jealous of their freedom to escape whenever they want.So she exists by resonating with nature and befriending the birds to fight against her abandonment  sorrow and unhappiness.I felt for Marsh Girl. I wanted her not only exist but live her life fully. I loved the romantic parts and I wished her happy ending.And about the final twist: My spider senses worked that time. Even it was sucker punching kind of surprise  it could still be expected. It still shook me to the core and I cried for her.This is my second round with the book. The author’s writing style a little exhausted me at the first but them words found their rhythm on my head like a lyrical and eccentric journey and I started to enjoy each chapter and let the words take the control of my heart and ache for the characters. As soon as I started listening to the audiobook  I fell in love this book one more time.So this was my favorite historical fiction of last year and I didn’t want to leave it without writing a few words how it made me feel after my second waltz with it!

My apologies to everyone who loved this  but unfortunately  I did not  and no one's sadder than me.Reading Where the Crawdads Sing was like stepping back in time to high school  when class-assigned books meant lots of award-winning fiction. Sure  there were plenty of literary merit found in these pages  but little joy was actually experienced from reading them.Starting at the age of six  Kya was slowly abandoned by everyone in her family  until she was the sole person left living in a little shack at the edge of town. As the years went by  shunned by the entire town  she slowly became known as the ""Marsh Girl "" a wild and lonely creature that few knew and most feared. This is her story. And when the town's golden boy dies  old prejudices flair up  and Kya finds herself at the receiving end of the town's anger and suspicion.This story is descriptive prose at its most verbose  and no detail—the marsh  waterways  bugs  trees  animals  and sea shells—was too small to be included. But the story has little plot and even less character development. Especially in the beginning  when Kya didn't talk to or interact with a single person  the monotony of the writing almost did me in.The other big issue is that the story is pretty hard to believe. We're supposed to accept that Kya is able to fend for herself  which includes cooking  cleaning  going to the store  buying things  and coming up with ways to make money  all at the age of six. That is way beyond the realm of possibility  let alone probability. There's only so far my beliefs can be suspended  I tell you.That's not to say I didn't enjoy a single thing here because I did. I found the middle of the book to be the most engaging. That was when Kya started interacting with others and the writing became a little bit more interesting as a result. Tate and Jumpin' were my favorite characters  and every scene they were in grabbed me. But the juxtaposition of their scenes (alive and compelling) against the ones without them (descriptive and unchanging) made the latter feel even more dull and plodding by comparison.In the end  this book just isn't for me. Everything that others loved are all the same things I didn't. I prefer my books to have interesting plot advancement  nuanced character growth  and zippy writing  none of which this book had. Instead  the plot is straightforward  the characters all remain stubbornly the same throughout  and the writing is long-winded enough to deflate even the most enthusiastic of readers. ...more  ",

The plot is not much of a plot and the mystery makes up only a small section of the book  and much of it ends up being courtroom scenes and not much mystery. This book is basically Manic Pixie Dream Girl In the Marsh. We spend a long time with young Kya  abandoned  fending for herself  almost entirely isolated. I was willing to be patient through all that  to see what kind of person she would grow into because that had the potential to be very interesting.Except it was not. It became less interesting the longer I read. Because Kya doesn't act like a person who has been almost entirely isolated. She just acts like a regular loner. Sure  she may have some habits that fit with her strange upbringing  but she seems to understand people and language just like a regular person. I was nearly out of my head with frustration that the book had spent so long telling me how different she was only to have her be just the same as most people. (Deciding to never love again because everyone leaves you is a pretty regular-person thing to do when you're in your 20's  for example.)This isn't a book of deep psychological insight. You can probably guess from a couple of chapters in how it will end. (And you would be right!) There are no real revelations  the plot is pretty obvious ahead of time. And it's all rather confusing because there are sections where Owens writes well  her courtroom scenes are actually quite competent  but on both the broad strokes and the specific details nothing here really rings true. And the more time that passed the more I got annoyed with this book so it finally fell from 3-stars to a rare 2-star review. (I usually quit a 2-star book.) If you're going to give me a plot I've seen a thousand times  at least wrap it in some keen insight or character development. But sadly this was a failure for me all around. ...more  ,

Unfortunately  I should have DNF'd this one when very early in the book  my eyes glazed over and I began skimming pages and pages of descriptive writing. The author is a nature writer and those sections were undoubtably well-written. But I don’t care for overly descriptive writing. And then there's poetry. I skipped over those as well. Everything other reviewers say they enjoyed were things I intensely disliked. I struggled with believability. I won't list them all  but the implausibility of every single plot point was something I couldn’t get past. To make things worse  romance is not a genre I enjoy and the romance in this book had a very YA feel to it. Finally  I found the use of dialect distracting to read and often in the same paragraph a character would switch from local dialect to proper English.Sometimes my love of the story or the strength of the writing is enough for me to ignore implausibility and move past a few things I don't like. This wasn't one of those times.Recommended for readers who enjoy long  descriptive nature writing  and those who have no trouble suspending disbelief. If I had known these things before starting this book I would have skipped it  so perhaps my review will help other readers like me.* Thanks to Edelweiss for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review ...more  ,

The first half of this book was pretty close to marvelous  and then it went south on me (that is a pun). Anyway  after my attempt at weak humor  let me resume in a serious note to say I was expecting so much more than I got here.Kya is a mere ten years old in 1952 when she is deserted  albeit gradually  by all the members of her family and left to make it alone in the marsh country of North Carolina. She forms a real attachment and understanding of her environment  which would be a necessity to survive in such a place  and she mostly works that to her advantage. When a young man who was once a friend of her brother finds her alone and begins to offer some help and company  she learns to read and her life begins to take a turn toward something more than isolation and running barefoot through the woods.That part of the story was interesting to me. I was interested in how she would survive  whether she would connect with the outside world  and of course how she would tie into the parallel story of the 1969 murder of a young man from the neighboring town. Then  in what seemed an abrupt change of tone  the story devolved into what I would deem chick lit. The plot became shallow and the author seemed to me to have lost the thread of her story and veered into another realm.I am sorry this didn’t work for me. I wanted it to  indeed I thought it was going to. Perhaps it is me. Since it is a group read  I am anxious to see what the other members of the group saw that perhaps I did not.I had originally rated this a 3-star read  but after reflection I find that I strongly feel it was only ""OK"" and therefore I have revised the rating to 2-stars. I think I felt shy of giving it only 2 when so many of my respected friends had given it 5...but truth should prevail. ...more  ",

The only thing it really had going for it was the plot  which was definitely a good one  and it is too bad that it got wrecked. I am at a loss to put this book into any kind of genre. Romance? YA? Courtroom drama? Murder mystery? I rather suspect that the author had the idea  first and foremost  to weave a story around how human behavior imitates that of wildlife  was fascinated by the marsh area of NC and fashioned a story around this. As a result the book neither flies nor swims. We might  on one page  get a lot of scientific information about insects  birds and plants  then we are back to the romance style of “her cheeks burned ” “her groin throbbed as if all her blood had surged there.” “her long hair trailing in the wind” and “he reached out and ran his fingers across her firm breasts.” Did I mention that she had black hair and red lips? And that she spontaneously recites poetry out loud on the beach?Some books have unlikely coincidences  some have downright contrived ones and others have those that are highly unlikely and therefore plain unbelievable. In the first and second cases  a book can still make it if the characterisations  settings and plot are well done. In the third case  unless you are talking about a fairy tale  you have to be either really romantically minded or you just go along with whatever for the sake of entertainment. “Crawdads” falls into the third category.It is rather unbelievable that  even with an abusive and alcoholic father  the rest of the family would simply abandon their six-year old daughter and sister  unless they were totally depraved  which the author portrays them as not. It is unbelievable that not one single adult in the nearby town would know that the girl was in the marsh by herself and thus make some effort to help her. I will put the rest of the “unbelievables” at the bottom in a spoiler alert. Aside from them  there are the errors and other annoying facets.Such as the author’s use of the vernacular  but only for the bad folks. The good folks all speak proper English. Such as the author’s fascination with southern food  especially grits  black-eyed peas and turnip greens  which are mentioned ad-nauseum.Spoiler alert: Unbelievable that the girl  who did not learn to read until age 14  would then go on to become a self-educated scientist and artist and even write several books  all while being entirely on her own in the wilds. It is unbelievable  since she wasn’t that far from town  that she would never seek out any contact with anyone besides her two suitors and an old black couple. Especially since she was a “looker” and wore white cut-off jeans (really??) when she went to town to buy groceries. How could everyone be so mean to her unless she was plain weird (which we are assured she was not). No  it was that all the town’s people were just narrow-minded and mean…except for of course the one golden boy with the golden locks. ...more  ,
9781472154668,it was amazing,  4.5 stars rounded up .A story of survival  of what the depth of loneliness feels like when a young girl is abandoned first by her mother  then her four siblings. Even at five Kya understands why they left - because of her father  because of his meanness  his abuse  his drinking. What she doesn’t understand is why they left her behind and neither could I. She remains pretty much alone since her father comes and goes until he doesn’t come back. It was gutting as she sits on the beach with the gull 4.5 stars rounded up .A story of survival  of what the depth of loneliness feels like when a young girl is abandoned first by her mother  then her four siblings. Even at five Kya understands why they left - because of her father  because of his meanness  his abuse  his drinking. What she doesn’t understand is why they left her behind and neither could I. She remains pretty much alone since her father comes and goes until he doesn’t come back. It was gutting as she sits on the beach with the gulls not wanting them to fly away and leave her too. Heartbreaking how she is neglected and abandoned  remembering the beatings  trying to figure out a way to eat. Atmospheric is an understatement  and I don’t use that word often because it seems overused sometimes but this place  the marsh permeates just about everything that is meaningful in this story beginning with Kya’s realization “And the marsh became her mother.” The marsh becomes her life  her livelihood  the essence of who she becomes through her self learned expertise of the insects and the birds  her art. But is it enough to heal her? The kind hearts of Jumpin’ and Mabel who help a little girl alone and in need  the only human contact she has until her brother’s friend Tate comes into her life  but is that enough to help her heal ? I love the writing  fabulous descriptions of the marsh. The marsh and its inhabitants  the insects  the fish  the birds which pique Kya’s curiosity  give her so much joy and company  and allow her to become the expert she does become on the marsh and marsh life. But is that enough to make Kya whole after so much hurt and loneliness?There’s a murder mystery  not my usual fare  but I was totally engaged  trying to come up with who the murderer was  totally engaged in the courtroom scenes. I gave it 4.5 stars because there were a couple of things that felt not quite realistic. But when I woke up thinking about this story  I knew I would round it up to 5 stars . I don’t often cry over books  but this one definitely brought me to tears at a number of places. Overall it was such a fabulous read  heartbreaking in so many ways  with wonderful writing and characters  a stunning portrait of a place  of the trauma of loss and loneliness. My heart was always broken for Kya  a character to remember. An unforgettable ending. This was a monthly read with Esil and Diane and as always I appreciate their thoughts as we read together. In this case  we have very similar feelings about this beautiful story.I received an advanced copy of this book from G.P. Putnam’s Sons through Edelweiss.  ...more  ,
9781472154668,did not like it,"  Wow.Like so many people  I read this book because my book club chose it. Unlike so many people  I am not impressed. Not even a little bit. A lot of times when a book is rated this high  I tend to think it's me and not the book. But nope. This time I fully believe it's the book.This will be ranty and in the order in which things made me want to rant. No apologies. I should've known things weren't going to go well from the title alone. Crayfish are all over the place  but they don't sing in any of Wow.Like so many people  I read this book because my book club chose it. Unlike so many people  I am not impressed. Not even a little bit. A lot of times when a book is rated this high  I tend to think it's me and not the book. But nope.

Crayfish are all over the place  but they don't sing in any of those places.*I definitely knew this wasn't the book for me on the very first page. I absolutely abhor overwrought prose that reads like the author sat down with the intention of writing the next Great American Novel and therefore had a certain number of adjectives and metaphors to fit on each page to prove their work was worth the accolades it was sure to get with sentences like: ""Swamp water is still and dark  having swallowed the light inits muddy throat. Even night crawlers are diurnal in this lair. There are sounds  of course  but compared to the marsh  the swamp is quiet because decomposition is cellular work. Life decays and reeks and returns to the rotted duff; a poignant wallow of death begetting life.""There is beautiful imagery  and then there is pretentious cobbling together of SAT words and figurative language so it seems deep but really isn't. For me  this was the latter. And so much of the book is just that overly flowery language barfed over every page for no reason  saying nothing or not making a lick of sense with what it does say. But it sounds pretty! So! Art!Then there was the massive eye-brow raising I did when I discovered this was taking place in North Carolina. The dialect. AGHHHHH!!!! This is why authors shouldn't use dialect when they write. You have to know a place so well in order to do that. Southern hick does not equal southern hick does not equal southern hick. There are (at the very least) five different dialects spoken in North Carolina. I attended Appalachian State University in Boone. The majority of my professors could tell which region each NC native was from by a couple sentences. I had a few who could get within two counties of where they were born after hearing them speak. Yeah. Kya's father's dialect would be exceedingly different from everyone else in their community as he is from the mountains and they are in the Outer Banks. Those are so distinctive and nothing alike. No one else in the world speaks like the Pamlico Sound people of NC. And it is rather hard to capture its cadence and brogue on page so just don't try. You will fail. (Owens totally failed.) Is that nit-picky? Maybe. But I'm more concerned with how the dialect was used. Every ""good"" person in the book overcame their dialect to learn to speak ""proper"" (ugh I hate even typing that word) English. Are you telling me Kya  who didn't have TV or radio as influence  lost her dialect with no practice and no outside influence because she was just...smart??? Good???? Same with Tate. But Chase kept his so we knew he was bad and a threat. There's some classist nonsense imbedded deep in that  and I am not here for it in any way. It's particularly annoying as it reads the way I imagine people pretend to speak when they're speaking ""southern hick"" to be mockingly superior but have never actually heard a real human in the south speak.**Then I reached the part on p57 where Kya's dad says of his family:""They had land  rich land  raised tobacco and cotton and such. Over near Asheville. Yo' gramma on my side wore bonnets big as wagon wheels and long skirts. We lived in a house wif a verandder that went a'the way around two stories high. It was fine  mighty fine.""I actually took a screenshot and sent it to my husband who was born and lived his entire life ""near Asheville"". His response  ""What in the world?"" What in the world indeed. A. No one from western NC talks like this. And Kya's father didn't move to the OBX until he was an adult  so he would still have his home dialect. Any student of language knows you don't shed and switch an accent easily once you're in adulthood. It takes practice. And even then the results are dodgy. Also this is not how Pamlico people speak anyway. See my rant about dialect above.B. Does Owens know Asheville is in the mountains??? (Tobacco was grown in the mountains though not nearly as much or as successfully as in the Piedmont. Cotton is waaaayyy harder. It gets too cold and rains too much. Also there's just not enough flat  arable land to make it worth the effort. I know there was a cotton mill in Asheville at the time  but I've never heard about people growing the cotton around there. If they were  it had to have failed more than half the time and not because of weevils. It's just not hot enough long enough. And no one was getting rich off agriculture and building plantation style houses there with slaves as was mentioned later in the book. Western NC was not like the Deep South. Because it is MOUNTAINS. Anyone who has ever driven to Asheville from the Piedmont knows exactly how mountainous. It's like flat flat flat whoa we're going UP. There's not enough flat land for plantations.) Then there was the part where Tate's mom went to ASHEVILLE for a bike because they didn't have it at the local store. Like WHAT??? She didn't try Wilmington? She drove past Greenville  Raleigh (the capitol)  Durham  Chapel Hill  Greensboro  Winston-Salem  missed exits to CHARLOTTE (the largest city)  to drive up a mountain for a bike? Literally no other city in NC had it? it takes SIX HOURS to drive from the Pamlico Sound to Asheville on a good traffic day in the year of our Lord 2019. Do you know how long it would've been in the 50s??? Good Grief  what is this woman's obsession with Asheville? And does she believe it is somewhere near the coast rather than on the complete opposite end of a rather long state?Which is how I knew no matter how smart she sounded or how much she might know about science and wildlife  Delia Owens didn't bother to research squat about North Carolina. Or she did and then disregarded it for whatever reason. Maybe she thought the Outer Banks and Asheville as NC's top tourist destinations were the names she needed to drop to make her book sound authentic??? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Huge parts of the novel are a giant snooze fest of nature this nature that and here's some more nature. And also grits. Because this is SOUTHERN y'all. In case it hasn't been hammered in yet.There were some freakin' awkward sexual scenes. Then there were the long drawn out court scenes that were just so tedious. I gathered from these scenes Owens is also unclear about travel times from the Greenville to the OBX. (Also I’m not sure if there ever was a Piedmont Hotel in Greenville  which is in the coastal plain and not the Piedmont. However  there IS one in Waynesville  which is also not in the Piedmont. Waynesville is in the mountains near.....guess where....Asheville.) Someone buy the woman a freakin’ map since she clearly doesn’t know what Google is. The working of the town vs Kya also bothered me. It's like Owens knows that the OBX people are a difficult community to become a part of without truly understanding the whys and hows of it all. Kya's character development was just so frustrating overall. And some of the stuff she accomplishes requires a tremendous suspension of disbelief. Owens definitely wanted the reader to see her a certain way. She is a manic pixie dream girl in a marsh until suddenly she isn't...(view spoiler)[ I was SO MAD about that. Because I hate when men write manic pixie dream girls. But when women do it? I'm enraged. Way to take it to your own gender. Then it turns out Kya should have a shirt that reads  NOT YOUR MANIC PIXIE DREAM GIRL in fluorescent letters. When I got to the end  I was so angry. Because the Kya we got a glimpse of those last couple of pages  WHER THE HECK WAS SHE THE ENTIRE BOOK? I want to read a book about that complicated  brilliant girl and recognize her as such through the whole thing. Ugh. Give me the Kya who can cold-bloodedly commit a well thought out murder  convince a jury she didn't  make a good portion of the community feel guilty for even suspecting her in the first place  and live a happily contented life forever after. It would have been way more interesting than what came up to that point. I FEEL SO CHEATED. And you know it's just because Owens wanted the element of surprise. But it wasn't really THAT surprising. Why wasn't I allowed to appreciate Kya for the vengeful goddess she was in planning that and executing it beautifully. Don't give me this knowledge with no insight AFTER SHE'S DEAD. Let me SEE ALL OF THAT.  (hide spoiler)]And finally rant-wise  Owens doesn't seem to know quite what she wants this book to be. Is it an ode to nature? Is it a crime novel? Is it literary fiction? It's kind of like she wanted to write the crime novel but genre writing is too plebeian  so here comes the overwrought language and navel gazing. Because ART. The nature part was her falling back on what she was comfortable with I think. *Crayfish do  I learned from my research  make a noise but we don't often hear it as they can make it underwater as well as out of water. It sounds like tap dancing. No singing even remotely flirted with. Where the Crawdads Tap Dance doesn't have the same ring I guess. And also doesn't narrow things down geographically. I did wonder why it wasn't called Where the Cicadas Sing. Because those sing. And are on a 17 year cycle. Which would have fit PERFECTLY with the timeline of the book. So color me confused. I know NC can be overrun with cicadas  but I'm not sure if the Pamlico region has them or not. Still would have made more sense than the actual title. (Again  it sounds flowery and important. Doesn't mean it has depth or meaning.)**My husband decided at age 13 to get rid of his accent. He worked long and hard at it. He did it by listening to network TV anchors and copying their speech patterns. It took years of concentrated effort. It's still not completely gone though he can pass for not being southern in other parts of the country. And when he's home? It comes back full force with all its dialectic eccentricities. I've lived the majority of my life in the Southern Appalachian mountains. Everyone here still knows I'm an outsider the second I open my mouth despite the fact my midwestern relatives swear up and down I have an accent now. And people here in eastern Tennessee are uncertain about my husband because he sounds kind of like them but not quite. (He's let his accent come back more since settling here because it helps with the not being considered an outsider. That's as important in southern Appalachia as it is in the OBX if you want to be embraced by the community.) But a single gorge changed the dialect between eastern TN Appalachian and western NC Appalachian just enough natives here recognize his accent as being not quite theirs. BY THE WAY my husband was just as smart after training out his accent as he was when he had it at its thickest. He knew he needed it gone to be a journalist  so he got rid of it. He was literally asked to ""speak southern"" by people in Michigan when we lived there briefly more than once so they could laugh about it. Which is f***ed up. Southerners speak the way they do for cultural and geographical reasons and it has nothing to do with the amount of intelligence or righteousness they have. ...more  ",

With that in mind  when I started this  the only thing I knew about it was its hype – I knew zero about the story  genre  type of book  etc. I just had a cover and a title!Did it live up to the hype?I think it did. I was entertained by the story and found it very easy to follow. It was a bit of historical fiction with some mystery involved eventually rounding off with a little courtroom drama. One of my favorite phrases to use when applicable is that “heart-strings were pulled”  and there was definitely some of that happening here. I think if you like a good  well-told story you will like this one. Who do I recommend it to?Historical fiction fans for sure. Especially those interested in mid-20th Century American fiction. Issues of race and public perception at that time are key to the plot.I am not sure there was enough mystery/courtroom drama to interest fans of those genres if that is specifically what you are looking for. But  there is enough if you just need to satiate a small hunger.Also  while only a little steamy at times  I think fans of stories with some romance will enjoy this one. Again  if you need a lot of hot a heavy in your romance  you will not find it here  but the relationships in the story should be of interest.Should you read it?I feel like this story has a little of a bunch of genres and not too much of any. Because of this  I think it will appeal to a wide audience. So  if you have seen the hype in your feed  too  and have been wondering  I think you should try it out. You may not be blown away  but I don’t think you will be disappointed. ...more  ,

By ten she was alone in the Marsh raising herself  her main source of comfort the natural life found in the North Carolina Marsh  the gulls she fed daily. She learned not to trust nor depend on anyone but herself. She was smart  curious  feArless and so lonely. As if this character wasn't enough to remember  there are also some supporting characters that play an integral part in her life. Jumpin and Mabel  a black couple that try to help Kya in whatever way she will accept. Tate  who has known her since she was small  teaches her to read anc much more. What will one do in the face of such loneliness? How much will they sacrifice if they reach out  trust? Prejudice is a big theme  because as the Marsh girl she is considered illiterate  unclean  and none in the village reach out to help. There is of course a villian  who claims to love her  but marries another  breaking her heart . This is there another thread comes in  a story told in alternate chapters  as when he is murdered   she is accused. Also where another wonderful character comes in  a man  74 years old  a retired lawyer who comes out of retirement to defend her against a town that already assumes she is guilty.I could nitpick a few things  but I won't. I loved and learned much about the natural world  a different way of looking at things. On walks I take along the river I will look at things I ordinarily wouldn't.

The Audiobook narrator -Cassandra Campbell  completely transported me to this world. The voice of Kya was PERFECT!!!! She used many different inflections for each character. I wanted to know Tate Walker and Jumper...but it’s Kya Clark  who dominant my heart and thoughts. She was not only abandoned by her family - but so many in her town rejected her. Abandonment as a child - hours upon hours of a solitary life ... playing in creeks  climbing trees  mudboarding the surface of the beach waters  digging for crabs  no parents around - is a memory which comes back to me from my own childhood....wandering outdoors...Kya Clark is tenacious- brave - resilient- an indomitable heroine....but has flaws too...which made me like her more. The circumstances of her unfortunate family inheritance is heartbreaking enough...but to suspect her of a crime... of murder? - it was almost hard to suspend belief. And so ugly to have a reputation as ‘swamp trash’. And how is it possible - and why - for heavens sake would a little girl kill an older bigger football player  Andrew Chase? There is suspense in this novel that I didn’t expect or know anything about when I started reading this.

Owens paints the surroundings just like Kya paints  with a fine brush intent on getting every detail right. There are so many heartbreaking moments in this book. Kya just can’t understand why everyone leaves her. The murder mystery was very well done and I had no clue how it would play out. The suspense was killing me. So  this is my first five star book of 2019. It has everything - beautiful writing  great characters and suspense. Highly recommend it! ...more  ,

Barkley Cove  North Carolina- 1969Kya Clark- aka- “The Marsh Girl’ has been abandoned  one by one  by every single person in her life. She lives by the seat of her pants  in a shack  eluding everyone  except a friend of her brother’s named  Tate. Tate watches out for Kya  when he’s able  and teaches her to read  among other things. As time moves on  however  despite a deepening affection for Kya  Tate knows he'll have to leave  and go away to college. While he's away  the myth of ‘The Marsh Girl’ will solidify forevermore. Kya will face a challenge like no other  and her fate will rest in the hands of the residents of Barkley Cove  with folks who have taunted her  shunned her  and judged her  her entire life.In 2016-17  there were several stellar novels written  which centered around children or teens raised in a turbulent  ‘off the grid’ environment  living in harsh conditions and under the care of an unreliable  or unstable father. While they were all quite compelling and effective  I wasn’t sure I wanted to tackle another one with a similar theme. Yet  with more and more high praise pouring in and one stellar review after another posted by readers  I began to regret my decision to pass on this one. So  obviously  I succumbed  and checked it out of the library. I never doubted the book would be a good one  I just didn’t know if I had the emotional strength right at this moment to tackle the topics of abuse and neglect. But as it turns out  this story isn’t really about the escape from an unconventional upbringing  or about the harsh survivalist or endurance skills needed to cope with an unforgiving landscape  as I had originally thought. While the story certainly drives home the cause and effects of abandonment and the cycles of domestic abuse and violence  this is also a very tender coming of age tale  a story of survival  but also a story of real friendship  true love  and what it means to truly feel free. Kya suffers a great deal of heartbreak  even from unexpected sources  but seems to have resigned herself to a way of life she believes is really her only true option. But  all of it is threatened when a body is found in the marsh  and Kya’s life is suddenly under a white-hot spotlight. The author does a fantastic job with the ecological descriptions and drawing the reader into the beauty Kya sees in her environment. The rich characterizations  especially with Kya’s character study  is another area in which the book excels. There are layers of thought -provoking topics  and a stunning revelation that knocked my breath out  but for those who are sticklers for realistic fiction  this one stretches the boundaries of plausibility in many places. However  you should allow yourself to go along with it  because that is part of the beauty of fiction  and it is well worth any required suspension of belief. Ultimately  I was exceedingly glad I gave this book a try. It was everything I knew it would be  but it was a lot more than I anticipated. As a fan of courtroom drama  I enjoyed the trial scenes  and the mystery elements  but of course it is Kya who stole my heart and made me feel envious for to the kind of freedom and way of life she willingly sacrificed so much to maintain. 4 stars ...more  ,

Still  Owens' might be the best writer of the three  and is at her best describing the flora and fauna of the North Carolina wetlands. All three of the books are touted as debut novels (which I guess technically is true)  but Owens is already an award-winning and bestselling author of non-fiction wildlife books. Let’s breakdown what I like and didn’t about this novel. Delia Owen’s and her publisher clearly knocked it out of the part with the cover and title. But more important - Owen’s writing is lush and vivid  mostly in setting  but the characters felt fully formed to me as well. The plot was rich  first with a dysfunctional family  then as a survival story  and finally as a murder whodunit. I did like how the author interspersed the beginnings of the murder mystery component in the form of flash forwards  throughout the book  increasing the conflict and intrigue earlier into the book. And while the author left me enough clues to guess the ending  it was engaging until the end. My biggest issue was that the plot was largely predictable. The plot flowing along like a meandering river  not like the twists and turns and tributaries of a dense marsh. The pacing wasn’t bad  but it did get a bit choppy in the middle. I don’t want to leave any spoilers  but let me just say  a few plot points weren’t surprising  but they popped up  out of nowhere  making me feel like I had missed some pages. In addition to the plot  I also never became invested in the characters  maybe because I’m a little burned out on this type of story line. While the swamp and the creatures and the waterways felt real enough to me  the characters themselves  while being well described and true to their motives  didn’t quite pull me in.Big picture  I enjoyed reading the story  never felt bored  but it was as much of the description of the setting and the major plot questions  then it was an emotional investment. A descriptively written  and interestingly plotted story that transitions from a coming of age tale to a murder mystery. ...more  ,

Absolutely wonderful descriptions.The author does a magnificent job creating the character of Kya  with details that make her come alive on the page. This book would have worked fine just as a coming of age novel minus the mystery of the murder.The insertion of the secondary plotline is disruptive and breaks the flow of the story. Part of the problem is the dramatic shift in voice from Kya to the sheriff. Kya is handled masterfully  the sheriff  not so much. These disruptive scenes are kept short but they are still speed bumps that urged me to put the book down. The author is a wonderful craftsman. At about page 150 the author wanted to emphasize one part of a scene and shifted from past tense to present tense just for a few paragraphs. The transition and its impact were wonderful  and done so well it was practically invisible.The story is character driven which is my favorite kind of book  however when handling the mystery part of the story  the protagonist doesn’t dig up the clue. Two different witnesses at two different times  and long after the crime has occurred  comes forward and says  “Oh  I might have seen something that night. I just didn’t think it was important.” For me this too is a minor distraction but it could have easily been avoided. The character voice matures as the character gets older and is real and believable. This is difficult to do and the way it is done here is truly an art form.I all but put the book down three quarters of the way through when the murder case was described. I just couldn’t buy it. The quick alternating scenes in that last quarter of the book  the jail and court scenes too often disrupted the fictive dream and tossed me out of the story. There is a definite tone change that comes from a shift in the craft. The voice is lost with the shifting from character to character  too many points of view. And the use of cliché’s like “I walked into a door ” and “I jus’ didn’t fall off a turnip truck.” didn’t match the wonderful craft in the first three quarters of the book. It almost feels as if the ending had not been planned  or more likely was rushed.The ending was predictable because of the way the protagonist pov was handled (or avoided)  and that there really wasn’t any other possibility  no red herrings to choose from so it left only one possible outcome. There wasn’t twist at the end. I wasn’t surprised at all. So reluctantly I have to give this one four stars instead of a five plus.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series ...more  ,

It is rare to find a book that can make you laugh and cry in equal measure-- especially  I think  a nonfiction book --but this one managed it just fine.It's very British  with references to British TV shows I'm pretty sure the rest of the world has never heard of  so bear that in mind if you are a non-Brit thinking of reading this. But it is essentially a publication of the diaries Adam Kay kept while he was a junior doctor working for the NHS. It is a funny  moving portrait of a service that underpays  undervalues  and overworks its doctors  and yet  despite all of this  it is a love letter to universal healthcare.Kay shares his experiences training as an obstetrician-gynecologist  from the gory stories that made me cringe  to the devastating loss of patients  to the destruction of his personal relationships due to the long hours and last-minute demands. It sounds like a nightmare  but he keeps a good humour throughout. Some parts of it are genuinely very funny. Some parts are genuinely revolting.It exposes a lot that is wrong with the NHS  but never loses sight of how truly important it is. It wasn't until I came to live in California that I really understood how fortunate we were. I had lived in a bubble where healthcare was taken for granted as a human right and no one was ever told they couldn't be made better because they were too poor. The realization that some countries allowed people to die preventable deaths shook me to my core. It still does.It bothers Adam Kay  too. He finishes his hilarious and touching tales with a direct plea to the government and to us to take the NHS and its doctors seriously. To respect it and them. To not take the work done for granted. Such a powerful and important read wrapped up in a highly-entertaining package.Facebook | Instagram ...more  ,

He replied  ""Water lily."" Ah so...  (hide spoiler)]2. Abuse. (view spoiler)[The hospital had a system to help women admit to abuse  which was difficult as their partners often accompanied them to ante-natal visits. In the toilets they had a sign saying 'if you want to discuss any concerns about violence at home  put a red sticker on the front of your notes ' and there were sheets of red dot stickers in every cubicle.So the doctor saw a woman with a few red stickers on the front of her notes. It was very difficult to get the husband to leave the room. He tried  the midwife tried  the consultant tried and eventually they got her alone. The woman just clammed up  scared and confused and would admit to nothing. Eventually they established that the red dots were artistic decoration by her two year old child when they went to the toilet together.I think Ockham's Razor applies here!

And I feel like I can write this now  I no longer work there so these words are not a reflection on the business but merely the words of a disgruntled former employee. So  Adam came on a busy Saturday night where we had sold all the seats. His name was popular  and people wanted to hear what he had to say. He and his manager approached me to tell me about their show  the visiting companies would inform the front of house manger about the show’s running times and give details about the content of the performance. This was all standard stuff.Adam’s manager then told me that Adam had promised eight seats to some of his friends last minute. And whilst Adam skulked in the background  letting his manger do all the talking  she told me that if I didn’t find these eight seats for his friends they would pull the plug on us and not perform. And obviously this would have been disastrous for the theatre and its patrons. Me and my team had to magic up these eight seats in an already full auditorium. Not an easy task. And we could not turn any of our customers away who had already paid for their tickets. So  my review is getting a little bit personal  but it is still about the book and his work if you let me continue. Fifteen minutes into the show  one of the ushers walked out. She was absolutely horrified at the content of the performance. The case Adam was delivery to the audience  sent her back to a horrific childhood memory involving a close friend. Adam delivered the story with humour and mirth  making light of someone’s medical disaster. And from here I decided I must read his book to see what all the fuss is about and to make up my own mind  separate to the negative impression he had already made on me personally. After reading it  almost two years later  I can say only one positive thing: Adam can write well. He delivers the stories well  but here I question the ethics behind doing so. In all honesty  should we really be laughing at other people’s medical disasters? And should we really be selling them to make a cheap buck? I don’t think so. ...more  ,

There are  of course  also very sad stories  including the one that led the author to decide he had to leave. It would have been wrong to focus solely on the laughs  denying the inevitable traumas  near misses  and deaths  some of which may have been prevented by having a properly run  well staffed  less overworked team of doctors. If nothing else  you leave the book with the understanding that the NHS is barely getting by. This is the very reason Kay wrote the book  as rebuttal of the politicians' portrayal of junior doctors as money grabbing and lazy  but only in the final section does he address this directly. Instead  he shows you a doctor and other staff worked to the very edge of their ability to cope. It's eye opening and I left it feeling even more grateful for this amazing resource we have. One we need to protect. In mixing comedy and reality  Kay has found an effective way to show us some truths while making us laugh so hard we have to hold back tears. It's the best kind of learning. ...more  ,

He even finds himself having to organise his cover when he is off sick. There are numerous horror stories  the stress of making life and death decisions  and he is rightly left bitter about the way the government treats NHS junior doctors  not to mention the chronic NHS underfunding and staff shortages. Kay goes on to relate what for him is the final straw  a caesarian that results in a dead baby  and the mother having to receive a hysterectomy  for which he blames himself  even though it was not his fault  and which eventually culminates in him leaving the profession. This is a must read if you really want to know what life as a NHS doctor is like  I should warn you there are parts that are really not for the faint hearted  although there is joy to be found when patients and babies are saved. There is going to be a TV series based on the memoirs coming soon  with the actor Ben Wishaw taking on the author's role  I am really looking forward to seeing it. I recommend this memoir to those thinking of a career in medicine. ...more  ,

This is the first book in a while where I’ve read passages out to my husband while laughing out loud one minute and then had to hold back tears the next. It’s a full on rollercoaster of emotions that also seems to very accurately describe what it’s like to work as front line staff for the NHS. I should know  I do it everyday too  and we all have our stories to tell that encompass the best and worst of British medical care. It’s one of my favourite things about the job  hearing stories from everyone about ‘that time a patient shoved a remote control up their rectum’ or ‘remember that night shift a woman faked passing out’. I think it’s what binds and bonds you all together. The camaraderie. Told with a liberal dose sarcasm and self deprecating humour  the author manages to walk that tightrope between friend  colleague and reliable narrator to a finely tuned ‘T’. My admiration for other healthcare professionals is limitless  and will continue to be so. It’s really the awful and gut wrenching stories interspersed throughout (especially the last chapters) that make you realise how much pressure and guilt our doctors are under. And for little pay might I add. Day after day  night after night they fight to provide the best level of care they can without succumbing to sleep deprivation  depression or worse. There’s a lot of emotion here  a lot of anger and sadness that’s so hard to see  yet is oh so common in the increasingly frequent demoralised NHS worker.It’s a very bittersweet read  that I devoured in one day  and I’m sorry it’s over.

I fully appreciated the use of Harry Potter aliases.This gives a realistic picture of what it is like to work for the NHS as a junior doctor and jut trying to make your way up the ranks. It is a sad state the way these doctors and nurses are treated by those who employ them  and of course how they are treated by politicians: no breaks  back-to-back shifts  being under immense pressure  not going home  not getting a proper salary etc. The reality of their job is painful as well as the consequences of their job (examples: no social life  difficulty maintaining relationships  increased mental health issues among hospital staff).Adam Kay worked in the obs and gyn department so had many a funny story to tell  but also had the sadder stories to tell as well. While he is no longer a doctor due to a case he had that completely changed the person he was  he has also found that those still in the profession were also desperately wanting to get out of it at times due to the treatment they receive. While many stay in the profession to reach the level of consultant and enjoy the helping of others  the continuous cuts to NHS services and the treatment of those who maintain this service is completely unfair. It is another call to rally that the doctors in the NHS are under-funded  under immense pressure  suffer from unfair treatment (see above with regards to salary  rest  etc)... which leads to mishaps when dealing with patients (this can lead to many mistakes and negligence and suing when dealing with patients) and severe mental health problems. Adam Kay also reveals the immense stress he was under and how this causes him to have a really high increase in heart pressure when working. The British Journal of Psychiatry  2009  showed that young female doctors in the UK are two and a half times more likely than other women to kill themselves. ...more  ,

The writing style is not geared towards making you feel a deep connection with Adam however towards the end my heart really went out to him and is the reason I rounded up to a full 4 stars.The format took a while to get used to as some diary entries were so short they felt like Doctor Doctor jokes  but once I got used to it I could not stop reading.This was really entertaining  in fact at times I had to literally wipe away tears of laughter. But there were a few stories where I felt the author went over the line  where someone should have told him to leave it out of this collection. These made up only about 10% of the book so it was easy to forgive. I also found the footnotes explaining medical procedures very interesting and not as intrusive as footnotes normally tend to be.But this was not just all laughs  there were quite a few very touching stories that brought me back to reality  this is not a book full of fictitious jokes  it’s a book full of real people with serious medical problems. The overall impression I was left with was how utterly grueling the process of becoming a doctor really is  how the NHS is setup to grind the doctors down even further  getting to know the human (warts and all) behind the white coat and how much a thank you from a patient means.If you have an interest in medical memoirs and want a good laugh  then give this a try. ...more  ,

I think this book sums up why I never went into Medicine and in order to survive in the medical world  you need to detach yourself from some pretty horrific things.Kay describes mortality in a very glib way which I suppose is accurate coming from a Doctor who deals with death on a regular basis. To me though life is more sacred than that and someone's relative/loved one who has just died is briefly commented upon and then overshadowed by something which is crude and vulgar. Having read the first section of the book  life is deemed as cheap which is something I am not comfortable with (since I have a morbid fear of death) so I didn't appreciate this aspect.Furthermore  there are too many crude references for my liking. Kay focuses far too much on the 'downstairs'   and I'm not sure whether he finds some of these witty but they fall far short of the mark for me. I am not impressed by routine mentions of the word 'ringpiece' - ugh  or how medical professionals refer to Obs and Gynae aka 'brats and twats'. Again  to me this reads as really juvenile and immature humour - cheap laughs from those who don't actually have a GSOH. Although  it doesn't surprise me in the least. Since I liaise with this sector of people  my levels of respect for them have really plummeted. I didn't enjoy this book at all. The humour just wasn't funny  the way it was written sounded like the author was trying way too hard to impress the reader at times - I just couldn't gel with it. 1 star. ...more  ,

And  Adam Kay is not the most likable person  he can be cocky  narcissistic and make completely inappropriate jokes about his former patients  but at the end of the book when he shows his emotional side and reveals reasons left medicine and that part was hitting a bullseye for me. I could resonate with every single word he wrote  and I'm sure  most doctors can. ''It’s a system that barely has enough slack to allow for sick leave  let alone something as intangible as recovering from an awful day. And  in truth  doctors can’t acknowledge how devastating these moments really are. If you’re going to survive working in this profession  you have to convince yourself these horrors are just part of your job. You can’t pay any attention to the man behind the curtain – your own sanity relies on it. ....‘Would your peers have done anything differently in that situation?’ All my peers would have done exactly the same things and had exactly the same outcome. But this wasn’t good enough for me. I knew that if I’d been better – super-diligent  super-observant  super-something – I might have gone into that room an hour earlier. I might have noticed some subtle changes on the CTG. I might have saved the baby’s life  saved the mother from permanent compromise. That ‘might have’ was inescapable.I’d mocked consultants for being over-cautious before  rolled my eyes the moment they turned their heads  but now I got it. They’d each had their own ‘might have’ moment  and this is how you dealt with it.The other recurrent theme  doctor after doctor  is how everyone remembers the sad stuff  the bad stuff  so vividly. Your brain presses record in HD. They can tell you the number of the room it happened in  on a labour ward they last saw a decade ago. The shoes the patient’s husband was wearing  the song playing on the radio.''During the peak of the pandemic  I too thought about leaving medicine  I too ruminated on people who didn't make it. As one of my colleagues on youtube said - I just wanted to work somewhere where people weren't suffering all the time. Kay shows good  great and terrible sides of the job  and reading him was like talking to someone who had a similar experience and is blunt and honest about it  and consequently  I felt less alone in my own. As Kay said  being a doctor is both the best and the worst job in the work  but I don't blame him for at all for quitting and finding a different venture. ''These days  the only doctoring I do is other people’s words – I write and script-edit comedy for television. A bad day at work now is if my laptop crashes or a terrible sitcom gets terrible ratings – stuff that literally doesn’t matter in the scheme of things. I don’t miss the doctor’s version of a bad day  but I do miss the good days. I miss my colleagues and I miss helping people. I miss that feeling on the drive home that you’ve done something worthwhile. And I feel guilty the country spent so much money training me up for me just to walk away.''The book is at the same time hilarious and devastating  as life itself. Kay ends on the great note of rising awareness about over over-worked  under-paid medical staff that holds health system that will otherwise collapse. In the end  I could feel the genuine love he has for both his fellow colleagues and his patients  and his former work  and that is all that counts for me. ...more  ,

Without any exaggeration whatsoever  I have to say this book gave me more laugh-out-loud moments than any other book I’ve ever read!! It was so good (or bad  depending on your perspective  like my wife’s) that I had to stay on the other side of the house while reading this in order not to disturb Jean with the hilarity of it all. A few reviewers took offense to some of the humor  and I admit a bit of it may be construed as irreverent  but it made me happy! It’s hard to find happy in the world today  so I’m not going to apologize for how much I love Adam Kay’s sense of humor.This memoir is for the most part constructed as a series of anecdotes. At first  I wasn’t sure if that would work for me  but it took virtually no time to ditch that concern. During Adam’s training  he would make notes of all the notable events that happened each day  which made it easy for him to put his memoir together several years later. The book does have its serious moments. The young physicians in training sacrificed so much. They frequently worked over 100 hours/week with no extra pay added to their measly salaries. Time worked over what was expected contractually was considered free labor  and that was the norm rather than the exception. That was bad enough  but under no circumstances were these young doctors granted special time off. One woman had to work the morning of her wedding day. Your mother dies and you want to go to her funeral? Tough  if you are on the work schedule. Many personal relationships are broken during these training years. You have essentially no other life. There were times that Adam thought about changing career goals  especially when facing difficult life and death decisions while severely sleep deprived. The stress could be immense. But he kept going. He loved his job  though there was obviously too much of it. He discovered there is nothing better than making a difference in someone else’s life  especially if you actually save that someone’s life. I know that feeling—it’s the major thrust that keeps you going. Of note  there is minimal positive reinforcement from the system. Whatever little you get comes from the patients or their families or even just from yourself when you know you did a great job with a patient. But again  that all comes with huge sacrifices in terms of finances  personal relationships  and your own mental health. I could really relate to all of this  though overall I believe the NHS program was a tougher place to survive than my program at the Mayo Clinic. Adam Kay has my deepest respect.If you are need of some humor accompanied by an eye-opening look at the sheer dedication of young doctors in training  this is the book for you. I highly recommend it.  ...more  ,

Who am I???This book is special since it is an insight to the medical field. I read this as a medical student but I am reviewing it as a doctor now.🌟 The book had a shaky start and I was not impressed which I actually foresaw. I just didn’t expect that the author’s style is for me from the start but things were going in the right direction and I was intrigued so I continued to give it a chance.🌟 I didn’t know that the author was a Gynecologist and funny coincidence is that I read this one while preparing for my Gyne exam. I am mentioning this because I want to point out that Adam was apparently an excellent doctor and that the book was scientifically very accurate.🌟 The humor may have made a difficult topic easier to approach but it was not always funny nor it was always appropriate. I just wish that the book had a more serious tone at some points.🌟 I like that this showed how doctors and the medical workers in general suffer  it showed how there is a problem with the system. What I am going to say is that we doctors are human!! It may sound stupid but really people do think of doctors as robots who should function on 100% all the time  not have any negative emotions!When I got really sick earlier this year  the first response I was getting from like 99% of the people around me is “You are a doctor  you should not get sick”. I am pretty sure it is all in good spirits and meant as a kind of a joke but people really want that from us!🌟 I am ending with a quote that I loved and that sums our mission in life as doctors. I think Adam said it perfectly:  “So I told them the truth: the hours are terrible  the pay is terrible  the conditions are terrible; you’re underappreciated  unsupported  disrespected and frequently physically endangered. But there’s no better job in the world.” 🌟 Prescription: For all people in general and for medical workers specially. I already recommended this to my close friends/ colleagues! ...more  ,

I was about half way through and fading fast  only to come across an vignette about the doctor being called in to deliver a new-born 'mid-wank'  which ends with him completing the procedure ""still erect"". It was genuinely the most horrifying sentence I have ever read.So yeah  2 stars but mostly because (even though the book isn't really political itself) its popularity in the UK has contributed to conversations about how hard junior doctors work and how valuable their contributions are to the NHS. ...more  ",

I think it would be false just to include all the happy and uplifting stories  and leave out the sorrow. It was one particular sad and heartbreaking event that causes this Doctor to decide to leave medicine. Of course  I won't spoil the reason for any readers  so I'll let others discover that for themselves. The sad thing about this book for me  is the stone cold reality of if the NHS was adequately staffed  many near misses  wrong diagnosing and even deaths could definitely be avoided. I've had contact with many doctors  and I've felt messes around  passed from pillar to post while they try to figure out what was the matter with me. I've also had contact with some amazing doctors  that have literally saved my life.
